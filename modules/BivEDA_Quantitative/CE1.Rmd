## Scatterplots
<img src="../zimgs/no-dumping-drains-to-ocean.jpg" alt="No Dumping" class="img-right">
[Kelly (1998)](https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/jfo/v069n03/p0386-p0390.pdf) used data from the [Christmas Bird Count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Bird_Count) (in 1994) to examine the latitudinal variation in the sex ratio of [Eastern Belted Kingfishers (*Ceryle alcyo*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belted_kingfisher).  The scatterplot below illustrates the relationship between the percent of female Kingfishers and the latitude of the survey.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, par1=TRUE}
tmp <- read.csv("Kingfishers.csv")
plot(perc.female~latitude,data=tmp,xlab="Latitude (N)",ylab="Percent Female",pch=19)
```

Use this scatterplot to answer these questions.

1. What is an individual in this example?
1. What types of variables are the two variables used here?
1. What was the maximum latitude examined?
1. What was the minimum percent of females observed?
1. What are the values for both variables for the point at the very top of the plot?
1. How many surveys recorded fewer than 30% female Kingfishers?
1. How many surveys were between 40 and 45<sup>o</sup>N?
1. What is the association exhibited in this plot?
