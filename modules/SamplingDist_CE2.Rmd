## Expectations Based on the CLT
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/zimgs/computer-1.jpg" alt="Simulations" class="img-right">
The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) provides a mechanism for understanding what the sampling distribution of the sample means will look like. The specifics of the CLT are in the module reading (and should be in your module preparation notes).

In this exercise, you will be asked to identify what the CLT says the sampling distribution of sample means should look like for different shapes of the population distribution and sample sizes (n). Specifically, you will describe the shape, center (with a specific value), and dispersion (with a specific value) for each situation.

## Situation 1
Suppose that the population in this situation has the characteristics shown in the figure below.

```{r Sit1, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3.5,fig.height=3,par2=TRUE}
shape1 <- 1; shape2 <- 1
x <- seq(0,0.95,0.05)
y <- round(1000*stats::dbeta(x,shape1,shape2),0)
x <- rep(x, y)
title.popn <- substitute(paste(mu,"=",muval,", ",sigma,"=",sigmaval),
                         list(muval=formatC(shape1/(shape1+shape2),
                                            format="f",digits=2),
                              sigmaval=formatC(sqrt((shape1*      shape2)/(((shape1+shape2)^2)*(shape1+shape2+1))),
                                               format="f",digits=3)))
old.par <- par(mar=c(3,2,2.25,1),mgp=c(1.7,0.4,0),tcl=-0.2,yaxs="i")
hist(x,freq=FALSE,breaks=seq(0,1,0.05),yaxt="n",xlab="Variable (X)",
     ylab="",main="",right=FALSE,col="gray90")
mtext("Population Distribution",3,line=1.3)
mtext(title.popn,3,line=0.1)
mtext("Frequency of Individuals",2,line=0.1)
par(old.par)
```

1. What is the shape, center, and dispersion of this population?
2. What would you expect, based on the CLT, the sampling distribution of the sample means to look like for n=10, 25, and 50. Record your expectations in the appropriate cells of the table below.

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
<thead>
<tr><th></th><th colspan=3 class="text-center">Expected from CLT</th></tr>
<tr><th>n=</th><th class="text-center">Shape</th><th class="text-center">Center</th><th class="text-center">Dispersion</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>10</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</tbody>

## Situation 2
Suppose that the population in this situation has the characteristics shown in the figure below.

```{r Sit2, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3.5,fig.height=3,par2=TRUE}
shape1 <- 1; shape2 <- 5
x <- seq(0,0.95,0.05)
y <- round(1000*stats::dbeta(x,shape1,shape2),0)
x <- rep(x, y)
title.popn <- substitute(paste(mu,"=",muval,", ",sigma,"=",sigmaval),
                         list(muval=formatC(shape1/(shape1+shape2),
                                            format="f",digits=2),
                              sigmaval=formatC(sqrt((shape1*      shape2)/(((shape1+shape2)^2)*(shape1+shape2+1))),
                                               format="f",digits=3)))
old.par <- par(mar=c(3,2,2.25,1),mgp=c(1.7,0.4,0),tcl=-0.2,yaxs="i")
hist(x,freq=FALSE,breaks=seq(0,1,0.05),yaxt="n",xlab="Variable (X)",
     ylab="",main="",right=FALSE,col="gray90")
mtext("Population Distribution",3,line=1.3)
mtext(title.popn,3,line=0.1)
mtext("Frequency of Individuals",2,line=0.1)
par(old.par)
```

2. What would you expect, based on the CLT, the sampling distribution of the sample means to look like for n=10, 25, and 50. Record your expectations in the appropriate cells of a table like that above.

## Situation 3
Suppose that the population in this situation has the characteristics shown in the figure below.

```{r Sit3, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3.5,fig.height=3,par2=TRUE}

x <- seq(0,0.95,0.05)
y <- round(1000*stats::dbeta(x,shape1,shape2),0)
x <- rep(x, y)
title.popn <- substitute(paste(mu,"=",muval,", ",sigma,"=",sigmaval),
                         list(muval=formatC(shape1/(shape1+shape2),
                                            format="f",digits=2),

                                               format="f",digits=3)))
