Some students have reported issues with watching the class preparation videos. Below are hints that have helped with these issues. Please [let me know](mailto:derek@derekogle.com) if you continue to have problems or if you have found other solutions.

## Vimeo Videos
The Vimeo videos require you to use the password "**NCStats**" (note capitalization and don't use the quotes). These vidoes may also have PowerPoint or other icons following the video link (see below), which lead to materials (slides, handouts, etc.) used in the video. Here is an example Vimeo video link:

* Video: [Randomization in R](https://vimeo.com/user45324800/random-numbers){:target="_blank"} [3 mins] [![Web](../../../img/web.png)](../../../modules/DataProduction_RHO.html){:target="_blank"}  [![PDF](../../../img/pdf.png)](../../../modules/DataProduction_RHO.pdf) [![MSWord](../../../img/word.png)](../../../modules/DataProduction_RHO.docx)  [![R](../../../img/Rlogo.png)](../../../modules/DataProduction_RHO.R){:target="_blank"}


## YouTube Videos (IE and Firefox)
It appears that the videos open without issue in Internet Explorer. With Firefox, the videos may appear to not exist, but will appear if you put the cursor in the web address bar and press Enter. Here is a link to a sample YouTube video:

* Video: [Types of Conclusions](https://www.youtube.com/v/5zkg1w5zoQ0?rel=0&start=1597){:target="_blank"} [3 mins]


## YouTube Videos (Chrome)
In Chrome, the videos will NOT play with the way that I have linked to them. If you want to use Chrome with the videos, then you can change the "v/" portion of the URL in the address bar to "watch?v=" and change the "?" in front of "rel=0" to "&". Thus, an address like "https://www.youtube.com/**v/**yxXsPc0bphQ**?**rel=0" would be changed to "https://www.youtube.com/**watch?v=**yxXsPc0bphQ**&**rel=0".
