## Cafe Sales
<img src="../zimgs/cafe.jpg" alt="Cafe" class="img-right">
[DePaolo and Robinson (2011)](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n1/depaolo.pdf) reported on data collected from a cafe run by business students at Indiana State University.  The cafe was begun because a commercial vendor had closed a similar business.  The group of business students opened a replacement business and carefully monitored sales and costs over a ten-week period during the spring semester of 2010.  The students recorded extensive data in [cafedata.xls](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n1/cafedata.xls) that is described [in detail here](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n1/cafedata_documentation.txt).  One aspect of their study was to record the total number of coffees and sodas sold per day and the maximum daily temperature (F).  Download these Excel data with the line from above, rename the variables (column headings) to include no spaces, add a variable that represents the days since start of the cafe, replace all `na` values with `NA`, save the file in CSV format, load the data into R, **refactor** the day of the week variable to be in proper order (see section 3.2.2 in the book), and answer the questions below.

1. Perform a univariate EDA for the number of coffees sold.
1. Examine the effect of day of the week on the distribution of number of coffees sold.
1. Perform a univariate EDA for the number of sodas sold.
1. Examine the effect of day of the week on the distribution of number of sodas sold.
1. Construct a "take home message" from your analyses.
