<h1>Why is the R prompt a "+" rather than a ">"?</h1>
<p>The "arrow" prompt (">") is the standard prompt that R uses to tell the user that it is ready for input.  The plus ("+") is used by R when it expects the user to finish what they started on the previous line.  Thus, when you receive the plus prompt that implies that you did not "finish" something on the previous line.  Most of the time this means that you did not close a parentheses or a set of quotes.  The smartest thing to do when you see the plus prompt is to press the "esc"ape key or, if using R in MDI mode, the red "stop sign" icon in the R toolbar.  Then use the up-arrow to get your last (incompleted) command back and edit it so that it is complete.  Make sure you press "esc"ape before attempting to edit your command, though!!!!</p>
