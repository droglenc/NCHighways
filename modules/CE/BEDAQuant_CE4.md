## Cafe Sales
<img src="zimgs/cafe.jpg" alt="Cafe" class="img-right">
[DePaolo and Robinson (2011)](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n1/depaolo.pdf) reported on data collected from a cafe run by business students at Indiana State University.  The cafe was begun because a commercial vendor had closed a similar business.  The group of business students opened a replacement business and carefully monitored sales and costs over a ten-week period during the spring semester of 2010.  The students recorded extensive data in [cafedata.xls](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n1/cafedata.xls) ([alt. link to data](http://www.sic.edu/files/uploads/global/Math_and_Science_Division/Math_141/Cafedata.xls)) that is described [in detail here](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n1/cafedata_documentation.txt).  One aspect of their study was to record the total number of coffees and sodas sold per day and the maximum daily temperature (F).  Download these Excel data with the line from above, rename the variables (column headings) to include no spaces, add a variable that represents the days since start of the cafe, replace all `na` values with `NA`, save the file in CSV format, load the data into R, **refactor** the day of the week variable to be in proper order ([see this FAQ](../resources/FAQ/FAQs/reorder-levels.html)), and answer the questions below.

1. Perform a bivariate EDA for the number of coffees sold and maximum temperature. [*Carefully consider which one should be on the y-axis.*]
1. Describe the relationship between the number of cofees sold and the number of sodas sold.
1. How is the number of coffees sold related to the number of days since the cafe opened?
