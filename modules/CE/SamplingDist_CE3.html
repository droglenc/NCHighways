<h2>Checking the CLT</h2>
<p><img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/CE/zimgs/computer-1.jpg" alt="Simulations" class="img-right"> You can develop evidence to support (or not) the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) by (i) creating a known population, (ii) stating your expectations for the sampling distribution of the means from the CLT, (iii) repeatedly sampling from the population to construct a simulated sampling distribution of the means, (iv) recording results from the repeated samplings, and (v) comparing the observed results to what you expected from the CLT.</p>
<p>The <code>cltSim()</code> function (with no arguments) from <code>NCStats</code> provides an efficient method to create a known population, repeatedly sample from that population, and summarize the resulting simulated sampling distribution. For example, <code>cltSim()</code> produced the plots shown below. The histogram on the left is a known population distribution with the parameters (μ &amp; σ) shown. The histogram on the right is a simulated sampling distribution; i.e., the distribution of means from 5000 samples of size n from the known population. In RStudio, this plot will have a gear icon in the upper-left corner that will open a dialog box that allows you to modify n. Additionally, you can control two shape parameters that will alter the known population distribution.</p>

<p>Each situation below corresponds to the situation on the <a href="SamplingDist_CE2.html">previous exercise</a>. Here you will first use <code>cltSim()</code> to take samples from the given population, use those samples to create a sampling distribution along with its summary statistics (shown to the right on the plot above), and record your observations about the shape (normal or not), center (a specific value), and dispersions (a specific value) of the sampling distribution. You will then be asked to compare your observations (here) to what you expected based on the CLT (on the previous exercise).</p>

<h2>Situation 1</h2>
<p>The population is constructed by using <code>shape1=1</code> and <code>shape2=1</code> in <code>cltSim()</code>. [<em>Note that this creates the population that you examined on the previous exercise.</em>]</p>

<li>
Record what you observed about the sampling distribution of sample means for each of n=10, 25, and 50 in the appropriate cells of the table below.

Did each of your observations match your expectations (from the previous exercise)? Does this give you confidence in the CLT?
