<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/zimgs/taking-weight.jpg" alt="Cancer Cells" class="img-right">
Suppose that 1500 women followed a popular diet for a month.  A random sample of 35 of these women was taken and the results for weight gained are shown below.

<pre><code>
 n   mean    sd    min    Q1  median     Q3    max
35    6.7   7.3   -2.8   0.7     4.2   10.5   17.2 </code></pre>

Assuming that the standard deviation for all 1500 women was 7.1, test, at the 5% level, that the average weight gain per woman for the month was over 5 pounds.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).
