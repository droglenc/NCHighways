<img src="../zimgs/nhlhockey.jpg" alt="Hockey" class="img-right">
Two Northland students were interested in whether the average amount of playing time (mins) per game for NHL rookies differed between those that were drafted straight from college or those that were drafted from professional leagues (minors or European).  To answer this question they generated a random sample of 25 rookies from colleges and 25 rookies from professional leagues.

1. Identify the IVPPSS.  [*Note that there are two populations in this example so you should have two sets of parallel answers for the PPSS parts.*]
1. Fully describe the type of variable.

## Public Attitudes Towards Wolves in Wisconsin
<img src="../zimgs/wiwolf.jpg" alt="Wolf" class="img-right">
[Hogberg et al. (2013)](http://faculty.nelson.wisc.edu/treves/wolves/reports/hogberg_treves_shaw_naughton_2013surveyreport.pdf) were interested in determining if public attitudes towards wolves had changed following the 2012 wolf harvest (the first legal harvest of wolves in Wisconsin).  The researchers obtained surveys from 773 residents of Wisconsin that had participated in three previous surveys.  Among other things, the researchers were interested in determining if the percent of respondents who agreed with "*my tolerance for wolves would increase if people could hunt wolves*" had increased following the wolf harvest.

1. Identify the IVPPSS.
1. Fully describe the type of variable.
