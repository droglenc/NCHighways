## Cactus Growth

A researcher is investigating the growth of a certain cactus under a variety of environmental conditions. He knows from previous research that the growth of this particular type of cactus is approximately normally distributed with a standard deviation of 1.40 cm. Under the current environmental conditions that he is investigating, however, he does not know the mean. He does hypothesize that it is no more than 4 cm. To test this hypothesis he used a preliminary sample of 10 randomly-selected cacti. He found the sample mean for these cacti to be 3.26 cm. Use this information to test his hypothesis with &alpha;=0.05.

## Length of Northern Pike
<img src="zimgs/northern_pike.jpg" alt="Northern Pike" class="img-right">

[Owens and Pronin (2000)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0380133000706836) studied the age and growth of pike (*Esox lucius*) in Chivyrkui Bay on Lake Baikal. They found that the length of the sample of 30 pike in Lake Baikal was slightly right-skewed with a mean of 656.1 mm. Suppose that a recent article in an outdoor magazine reported the average length of all pike in this lake to be 600 mm long. It is known from previous studies that the standard deviation of pike length is about 130 mm. Perform a test, using a 95 confidence level, to determine if the mean length of pike reported by the researchers significantly differs from that reported in the outdoor magazine.

## Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome

A study by [Cheshire *et al.* (1994)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7854804) reported on six patients with chronic myofascial pain syndrome. The researchers determined the duration of pain for the six patients were 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, 2.8, 2.8, and 3.0 years. Test the hypothesis that the mean pain length was greater than 2.5 years at the 10% significance level. Assume that it is known that the distribution of duration of pain is normal with a standard deviation of 0.5 years.

## Cholesterol Levels
<img src="zimgs/cholesterol_blood_test.jpg" alt="Cholesterol Blood Test" class="img-right">

Suppose that it is known that cholesterol levels in women aged 21-40 in the U.S. has a mean of 190 mg/dl and standard deviation of 40 mg/dl. Suppose that we want to determine, at the 10% significance level, if the cholesterol level of Asian women is different from U.S. women as determined from 40 randomly selected Asian women aged 21-40 who had recently immigrated to the U.S. Assume that the Asian women have the same standard deviation as the U.S. women population. The data from this sample are found in [Cholesterol.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Cholesterol.csv).
