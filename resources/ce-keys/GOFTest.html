<h2>Preference for Bottled Water?</h2>

<li>

H<sub>A</sub>: “There is a preference among the water choices (i.e., the distribution of students will NOT follow a theoretical distribution of equal proportions among the water choices)” and H<sub>O</sub>: “There is no preference among the water choices (i.e., the distribution of students will follow a theoretical distribution of equal proportions among the water choices)”.
</li>
<li>
Goodness-of-fit test because (i) one population (students) were sampled and (ii) the response variable (water choice) is categorial.
</li>
<li>
This is quasi-experimental as the students were given a choice of only certain waters. The students were not obviously randomly selected (and were likely part of a voluntary response survey).
</li>
<li>
All cells in the expected frequency table (Table 1) were greater than 5; the assumptions for a goodness-of-fit test have been met.
</li>
<p>Table 1: Expected frequency of students (assuming that Ho is true) by water type choice.</p>
<pre><code>     tap Aquafina     Fiji     Sams 
   26.75    26.75    26.75    26.75 </code></pre>
<li>
The observed frequency table is shown in Table 2.
</li>
<p>Table 2: Observed frequency of students by water type choice.</p>

<li>
p-value=&lt;0.00005 (Table 3).
</li>
<li>
Reject H<sub>0</sub> because the p-value&lt;α.
</li>
<li>
It appears that there is a preference for water type by the students. Further analysis (Table 4) suggests that the students preferred the tap water.
</li>
<p>Table 4: Summary table of the proportion of students in each water type choice, with 95% confidence intervals and expected proportions from the goodness-of-fit test.</p>

<li>
From Table 4, one can conclude that between 38.4and 57.0% of the students chose the tapwater.

<h2>Habitat Use by Wild Turkeys</h2>
<ol>
<li>
α=0.05.
</li>
<li>
H<sub>A</sub>: “There is a preference by the turkeys for habitat (i.e., the distribution of turkeys will NOT follow the distribution of available habitats)” and H<sub>O</sub>: “There is NOT a preference by the turkeys for habitat (i.e., the distribution of turkeys will follow the distribution of available habitats)”.
</li>
<li>
Goodness-of-fit test because (i) one population (South Dakota tukeys) were sampled and (ii) the response variable (habitat use) is categorial.
</li>
<li>
This is observational as habitat use by the turkeys was simply recorded. The turkey observations were not randomly selected (the researchers likely chose days to sample).
</li>
<li>
All cells in the expected frequency table (Table 5) were greater than 5; the assumptions for a goodness-of-fit test have been met.

Reject H<sub>0</sub> because the p-value&lt;α.
</li>
<li>
It appears that the turkeys show a habitat preference in the spring. Further analysis (Table 8) suggests that the turkeys showed a strong avoidance of meadows, a moderate avoidance of Oak/Spruce habitats, and a moderate preference for aspen and pine habitats.
