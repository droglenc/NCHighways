Suppose that the length of all needles on a particularly large pine tree is known to be normally distributed with a mean of 75 mm and a standard deviation of 8 mm. Use this to answer the questions below.

1. What is the probability that a randomly selected needle is between 70 and 80 mm long?
1. What is the probability that a randomly selected needle is longer than 90 mm?
1. What is the probability that a randomly selected needle is less than 50 mm long?
