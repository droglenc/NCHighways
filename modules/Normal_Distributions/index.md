title: Normal Distributions
---

Many natural phenomena can be closely approximated by simple statistical distributions.  The most common of these distributions if the normal distribution, most often referred to by laypeople as the "bell-shaped curve."  Because of its prevalance, the normal distribution is the foundation of many statistical methods.  This module describes how to make calculations with a normal distribution.  These calculations are useful in their own right, but they also form the foundation for many of the methods used in later modules.

## Intended Learning Outcomes
After completing this module, the student should be able to ...

1. Describe the shape, center, and dispersion of a normal distrubtion.
1. Explain the physical characteristics of a normal distribution that are represented by the mean and standard deviation.
1. Estimate percentages of individuals and values of variables using the 68-95-99.7 Rule.
1. Identify the difference between "forward" and "reverse" types of calculations.
1. Accurately make "forward" calculations with R.
1. Accurately make "reverse" calculations with R.
