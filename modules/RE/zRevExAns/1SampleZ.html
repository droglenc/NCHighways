<h2>Cactus Growth</h2>
<ol>
<li>α = 0.05.</li>
<li>H<sub>0</sub>: μ = 4, H<sub>A</sub>: μ &lt; 4 where μ is the mean growth of all cacti.</li>
<li>A one-sample Z-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (growth) was measured, (ii) individuals from only one group/population were sampled (only one set of conditions considered), (iii) the population mean is compared to a specific value in the null hypothesis, and (iv) σ is known (given in the background).</li>
<li>The data are part of an experiment in which cacti were randomly selected.</li>
<li>σ is known. In addition, because the population distribution is normal (stated in the background), we do not have to worry about the size of the sample.</li>
<li>x¯ = 3.26.</li>
<li>Z = <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3.26-4}{\frac{1.40}{\sqrt{10}}}\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(\frac{-0.74}{0.44}\)</span> = -1.67.</li>
<li>The p-value is <span class="math inline">\(0.0473\)</span>.</li>
<li>H<sub>0</sub> is rejected because the p-value&lt;α.</li>
<li>The mean growth rate of all cacti under the experimental conditions does appear to be less than 4 cm.</li>
<li>A 95% upper confidence bound is warranted in this situation and will use a Z<sup>∗</sup> = 1.645. Thus, 3.26+1.645*0.44 or 3.26+0.72 = 3.98. Thus, one is 95% confident that the mean growth of all cacti under the experimental conditions is less than 3.98 cm.</li>

<h2>Length of Northern Pike</h2>
<ol>
<li>α = 0.05. (<em>Note that this is obtained from working backwards from the 95% confidence statement.</em>)</li>
<li>H<sub>0</sub>: μ = 600, H<sub>A</sub>: μ &amp;neq; 600 where μ is the mean length of all pike in Chivyrkui Bay, Lake Baikal.</li>
<li>A one-sample Z-test is required because a (i) quantitative variable (length) was measured, (ii) individuals from only one group/population were sampled (Chivyrkui Bay, Lake Baikal), (iii) the population mean is compared to a specific value in the null hypothesis, and (iv) σ is known (given in the background).</li>
<li>Observational study with n = 30 pike. No obvious randomization.</li>
<li>n = 30 ≥ 15 and the population is not strongly skewed (background says “slightly”&quot; right-skewed); σ is known.</li>
<li>x¯ = 656.1.</li>
<li>Z = <span class="math inline">\(\frac{656.1-600}{\frac{130}{\sqrt{30}}}\)</span> = 2.363.</li>
<li>The p-value is <span class="math inline">\(0.0181\)</span>.</li>
<li>Reject H<sub>0</sub> because the p-value&lt;α.</li>
<li>The true mean length of all pike in Lake Baikal appears to be different than 600 mm.</li>
<li>A 95% confidence interval is warranted in this situation and will use a Z<sup>∗</sup> = ± 1.960. Thus, 656.1 ± 1.96*23.74, 656.1 ± 46.53, or (609.57, 702.63). Therefore, one is 95% confident that true mean length of all pike in Lake Baikal is between 609.6 and 702.6 mm.</li>

<h2>Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome</h2>

<li>H<sub>0</sub>: μ = 2.5, H<sub>A</sub>: μ &gt; 2.5 where μ is the mean length of pain.</li>
<li>A one-sample Z-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (length of pain) was measured, (ii) individuals from only one group/population were sampled (patients with this syndrome), (iii) the population mean is compared to a specific value in the null hypothesis, and (iv) σ is known (given in the background).</li>
<li>An observational study that is not obviously random was used.</li>
<li>The population is normally distributed (given in the background) and σ is known (= 0.5). Thus, the test statistic below should follow a normal distribution.</li>

<li>It appears that the mean duration of pain for all patients may be longer than 2.5 years.</li>
