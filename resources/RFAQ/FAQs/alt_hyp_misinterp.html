<h1>R says the alternative hypothesis is true, even though the p-value > <font face="Symbol">a</font>.</h1>
<p>Typical results from <font face="Courier New" color="#FF0000">t.test()</font> look like this ...</p>

<pre><font color="#0000FF">        Welch Two Sample t-test
data:  1:10 and c(7:20, 200) 
t = -1.6329, df = 14.165, p-value = 0.1245
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -47.242900   6.376233 
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
  5.50000  25.93333</font></pre>

<p>The p-value in this example (third line of output) is greater than any reasonable value of <font face="Symbol">a</font> and, thus, one would conclude that the null hypothesis should not be rejected.  However, some people mistakingly interpret the fourth line of output as saying that the alternative hypothesis is true (and thus the null hypothesis is rejected).  R does NOT make the rejection decision for you.  The fourth line of output is simply a reminder of what you set the alternative hypothesis to in the <font face="Courier New" color="#FF0000">alt=</font> argument of <font face="Courier New" color="#FF0000">t.test()</font>.  You must decide to reject or not to reject the null hypothesis by comparing the p-value reported in the third line of output to the <font face="Symbol">a</font> that you have chosen.</p>
