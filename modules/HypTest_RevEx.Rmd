## Computing P-Values

1. Compute the p-value and make a decision about $H_{0}$ with the following information -- $\alpha=0.10$, $H_{0}:\mu=10$, $H_{A}:\mu>10$, $\sigma=5$, $n=25$, and $\bar{x}=12.1$. [See answer here](zRevExAns/HypTest.html#computing-p-values-1)
1. Compute the p-value and make a decision about $H_{0}$ with the following information -- $\alpha=0.05$, $H_{0}:\mu=50$, $H_{A}:\mu<50$, $\sigma=20$, $n=50$, and $\bar{x}=43.8$. [See answer here](zRevExAns/HypTest.html#computing-p-values-2)
1.Compute the p-value and make a decision about $H_{0}$ with the following information -- $\alpha=0.01$, $H_{0}:\mu=100$, $H_{A}:\mu\neq100$, $\sigma=15$, $n=100$, and $\bar{x}=98$. [See answer here](zRevExAns/HypTest.html#computing-p-values-3)
1. Describe why we must formally go through the steps of a hypothesis test to conclude that $\mu>11$ when we observe $\bar{x}=12.1$. [See answer here](zRevExAns/HypTest.html#computing-p-values-4)

## BOD in Effluent
<img src="zimgs/BOD_test_bottles.jpg" alt="BOD Test Bottles" class="img-right">

The managers of a wastewater treatment plant monitored the amount of biological oxygen demand (BOD; lbs/day) in the effluent of the plant each month from January 1991 to October 2000. The managers would need to take corrective actions if the average BOD over this time period was significantly greater than 2200 lbs/day at a 10% rejection level. Previous studies indicated that the standard deviation was 1200 lbs/day. Summary statistics from their sample of days is given below. Use this information to answer the questions below.

```
    n  Min. 1st Qu. Median   Mean  3rd Qu.   Max.
  118   630    1600    2240   2504     3193    6023
```

1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?
1. What is the test statistic?
1. Compute the p-value. [*Hint: Will need to use `distrib()`*]
1. Use the p-value to make a decision about $H_{0}$.
1. What does this mean for the managers of the plant (i.e., will they need to take action)? Explain!

## Medical School Admissions
<img src="zimgs/medschool_lecture.jpg" alt="Medical School Lecture" class="img-right">

Admissions representatives at the University of Minnesota medical school were concerned that the average grade point average of applicants in non-science courses had dropped below 3.7. A sample of 40 of the most recent applicants indicated that the mean was 3.60. Information from the Association of American Medical Colleges suggested that the overall standard deviation was 0.35. Use this information, and an $\alpha=0.05$, to answer the questions below.

1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?
1. What is the test statistic?
1. Compute the p-value. [*Hint: Will need to use `distrib()`*]
1. Use the p-value to make a decision about $H_{0}$.
 1. Was the representatives concern about the average gpa of applicants warranted?  Explain!

<div class="panel-body">The classic example deals with the population dynamics of an animal.  The null hypothesis says that the animal's population size is not declining, it is remaining stable over time.  The alternative hypothesis is that the animal's population is declining.  If the null hypothesis is true and you reject it (i.e., you say the population is declining when it really isn't) you have made a type I error.  This will likely lead resource managers to take actions to protect the animal.  This is not necessarily a bad thing for the animal, although it may be costly.  Conversely, if the null hypothesis is false and you fail to reject it (i.e., the animal is really declining but you say that it isn't), then you have made a type II error.  This is much more egregious mistake because now you will take no action to protect the animal; it may go extinct.  To me, losing an animal is much more costly (important) than overprotecting the animal.</div>
