<div id="time-spent-playing-video-games" class="section level2">
<h2>Time Spent Playing Video Games</h2>
<p>The time spent playing video games is very strongly right-skewed with an extreme outlier at 30 hours and another outlier at approximately 15 hours. The center is at a median of 0 hours and the dispersion is from a Q1 of 0 hours to a Q3 of 1.2 hours. The median and IQR were used because of the skew and presence of outliers. [<em>Results are derived from the figure and table presented in the question.</em>]</p>

<h2>Bank Transaction Times</h2>
<p>The bank transaction times are strongly right-skewed with no obvious outliers. The center is at a median of 93.0 hours and the dispersion is from a Q1 of 60.3 hours to a Q3 of 145.2 hours. The median and IQR were used because of the skew and presence of outliers. [<em>Results are derived from the figure and table presented in the question.</em>]</p>

<p>The distribution of creatine phosphate concentrations is slightly right-skewed with no obvious outliers (Figure 1). [<em>Note that I did not call the individuals above 200 outliers because they were only one bar removed, there were two individuals, and they “felt” like an extension of the right-tail.</em>] The center is at a mean of 98.3 and the dispersion is a standard deviation of 40.4. The mean and standard deviation were used because the distribution was not strongly skewed and outliers were not present.</p>
