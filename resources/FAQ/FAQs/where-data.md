Many times I will refer to data files that I have made available to you or, in the text, it will mention a file name with a ".csv" extension.  These files are available from [this webpage](../../data_107).  [This R Tutorial video](https://vimeo.com/user45324800/ncstats-preparedatawebpage) describes how to download these data and [this R Tutorial video](https://vimeo.com/user45324800/ncstats-loadcsvrstudio) describes hos to load these data into RStudio.
