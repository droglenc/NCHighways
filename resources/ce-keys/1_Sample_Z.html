An observational study as the women chose to be on the diet. There is clear randomization in this study.

H<sub>O</sub>: μ=50000, H<sub>A</sub>: μ&gt;50000, where μ is the mean number of raptors seen in ALL years at Hawk’s Ridge.
</li>
<li>
A one-sample Z-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (number of raptors) was measured, (ii)the individuals are from one population (all years at Hawk’s Ridge), and (iii) σ is known (=37000). Thus, the population mean is being compared to a specific value in the null hypothesis.
</li>
<li>
An observational sample of years that was not random was taken.

The assumptions are met because n=32&gt;30 and σ is known.

The test statistic is Z=2.780 (Table 1).

The p-value is 0.0027 (Table 1).

The H<sub>O</sub> is rejected because the p-value&lt;α (Table 1).

<li>
The mean number of raptors seen per year in ALL years appears to be greater than 50000.

I am 99% confident that the mean number of raptors seen per year in ALL years is more than 52967 (Table 1).
