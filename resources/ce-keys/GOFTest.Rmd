## Preference for Bottled Water?

```{r WaterCalc, echo=FALSE, results='hide', fig.show='hide', warning=FALSE}
w.obs <- c(tap=51,Aquafina=18,Fiji=17,Sams=21)
w.exp <- c(tap=1,Aquafina=1,Fiji=1,Sams=1)/4
w.chi <- chisq.test(w.obs,p=w.exp,rescale.p=TRUE,correct=FALSE)
w.chi
percTable(as.table(w.obs),digits=1)
```

<ol>
<li>&alpha;=0.01.</li>
<li>H<sub>A</sub>: "There is a preference among the water choices (i.e., the distribution of students will NOT follow a theoretical distribution of equal proportions among the water choices)" and H<sub>O</sub>: "There is no preference among the water choices (i.e., the distribution of students will follow a theoretical distribution of equal proportions among the water choices)".</li>
<li>Goodness-of-fit test because (i) one population (students) were sampled and (ii) the response variable (water choice) is categorial.</li>
<li>This is quasi-experimental as the students were given a choice of only certain waters.  The students were not obviously randomly selected (and were likely part of a voluntary response survey).</li>
<li>All cells in the expected frequency table (`r tbls("WaterExpTable",display="cite")`) were greater than 5; the assumptions for a goodness-of-fit test have been met.</li>

`r tbls("WaterExpTable")`

```{r echo=FALSE}
w.chi$expected
```

<li>The observed frequency table is shown in `r tbls("WaterObsTable",display="cite")`.</li>

`r tbls("WaterObsTable")`

```{r echo=FALSE}
w.chi$observed
```

<li>&chi;<sup>2</sup>=`r formatC(w.chi$statistic,format="f",digits=4)` with `r w.chi$parameter` df (`r tbls("WaterResults",display="cite")`).</li>

`r tbls("WaterResults")`

```{r echo=FALSE}

```

<li>p-value=`r kPvalue(w.chi$p.value,include.p=FALSE,latex=FALSE)` (`r tbls("WaterResults",display="cite")`).</li>
<li>Reject H<sub>0</sub> because the p-value&lt;&alpha;.</li>
<li>It appears that there is a preference for water type by the students.  Further analysis (`r tbls("WaterSum",display="cite")`) suggests that the students preferred the tap water.</li>

`r tbls("WaterSum")`

```{r echo=FALSE}
gofCI(w.chi)
```

<li>From `r tbls("WaterSum",display="cite")`, one can conclude that between `r formatC(gofCI(w.chi)["tap","p.LCI"]*100,format="f",digits=1)`and  `r formatC(gofCI(w.chi)["tap","p.UCI"]*100,format="f",digits=1)`% of the students chose the tapwater.</li>

## Habitat Use by Wild Turkeys

```{r TurkeyCalc, echo=FALSE, results='hide', fig.show='hide', warning=FALSE}
t.obs <- c(Aspen=61,Meadow=9,Pine=807,OakSpruce=1)
t.exp <- c(Aspen=0.0516,Meadow=0.1016,Pine=0.8371,OakSpruce=0.0100)
t.chi <- chisq.test(t.obs,p=t.exp,rescale.p=TRUE,correct=FALSE)
t.chi
gofCI(t.chi)
```

<ol>
<li>&alpha;=0.05.</li>
<li>H<sub>A</sub>: "There is a preference by the turkeys for habitat (i.e., the distribution of turkeys will NOT follow the distribution of available habitats)" and H<sub>O</sub>: "There is NOT a preference by the turkeys for habitat (i.e., the distribution of turkeys will follow the distribution of available habitats)".</li>
<li>Goodness-of-fit test because (i) one population (South Dakota tukeys) were sampled and (ii) the response variable (habitat use) is categorial.</li>
<li>This is observational as habitat use by the turkeys was simply recorded.  The turkey observations were not randomly selected (the researchers likely chose days to sample).</li>
<li>All cells in the expected frequency table (`r tbls("TurkeyExpTable",display="cite")`) were greater than 5; the assumptions for a goodness-of-fit test have been met.</li>

`r tbls("TurkeyExpTable")`

```{r echo=FALSE}
t.chi$expected
```

<li>The observed frequency table is shown in `r tbls("TurkeyObsTable",display="cite")`.</li>

`r tbls("TurkeyObsTable")`

```{r echo=FALSE}
t.chi$observed
```

<li>&chi;<sup>2</sup>=`r formatC(w.chi$statistic,format="f",digits=4)` with `r t.chi$parameter` df (`r tbls("TurkeyResults",display="cite")`).</li>

`r tbls("TurkeyResults")`

```{r echo=FALSE}
t.chi
```

<li>p-value=`r kPvalue(t.chi$p.value,include.p=FALSE,latex=FALSE)` (`r tbls("TurkeyResults",display="cite")`).</li>
<li>Reject H<sub>0</sub> because the p-value&lt;&alpha;.</li>
<li>It appears that the turkeys show a habitat preference in the spring.  Further analysis (`r tbls("TurkeySum",display="cite")`) suggests that the turkeys showed a strong avoidance of meadows, a moderate avoidance of Oak/Spruce habitats, and a moderate preference for aspen and pine habitats.</li>

`r tbls("TurkeySum")`

```{r echo=FALSE}
gofCI(t.chi)
```

<li>From `r tbls("TurkeySum",display="cite")`, one can conclude that between `r formatC(gofCI(t.chi)["Pine","p.LCI"]*100,format="f",digits=1)`and  `r formatC(gofCI(t.chi)["Pine","p.UCI"]*100,format="f",digits=1)`% of the turkey observations were in the pine habitat.</li>
