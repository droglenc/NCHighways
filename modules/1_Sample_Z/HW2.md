## Elk Density in Banff
<img src="../zimgs/elk-inBanff.jpg" alt="Elk in Banff" class="img-right">

[Hebblewhite (2000)](http://www.carnivoreconservation.org/files/thesis/hebblewhite_2000_msc.pdf) recorded the density (number per square km) of Elk (*Cervus elaphus*) in Banff National Park, Alberta, CA from 1986 to 2000. The raw data from his study are shown below. Further assume that it is known from previous studies that the standard deviation of density estimates for all years is 2 elk per square kilometer and the distribution is approximately normal. Use this information to construct and fully interpret a test, at the 10% significance level, of whether the mean density of elk is greater than 8 per square km.
