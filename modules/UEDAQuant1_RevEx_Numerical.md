In a preliminary study, a researcher recorded the weekly home range of five Red Kangaroos (*Macropus rufus*) in New South Wales. The five home ranges were 258, 310, 560, 470, and 502 hectares. Compute the median, mean, standard deviation, and range of these data "by hand."

<img src="zimgs/creatine_phosphate.jpg" alt="Creatine Phosphate" class="img-right">

The table below contains the concentrations (International Units per liter) of creatine phosphokinase (an enzyme related to muscle and brain functions) in 36 male volunteers. Compute the median, IQR, and range "by hand" and with R. Compute the mean and standard deviation with R. [*HINT: Create and then load data from a CSV file.*]

```
121  82 100 151  68  58  95 145  64
119 104 110 113 118 203  62  83  67

The table below contains the carbon monoxide levels (ppm) arising from one of the stacks for an oil refinery northeast of San Francisco between April 16 and May 16, 1993. The measurements were submitted as evidence for establishing a baseline to the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD). Compute the median, IQR, and range "by hand" and with R. Compute the mean and standard deviation with R. [*HINT: Create and then load data from a CSV file.*]

```
30 30 34  36  37  38  40  42 43 43 45
52 55 58  58  58  59  63  63 71 75 85
