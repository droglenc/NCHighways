## Popularity in Middle School
<img src="../zimgs/sports_kids_2.jpg" alt="Sports Kids" class="img-right">
[Chase and Drummer (1992)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1439167) examined sports as a social status determinant for children.  In their study, they surveyed 227 boys and 251 girls in grades 4, 5, and 6 from schools in Michigan to determine which criteria were most important in determining personal, female, and male popularity.  In one part of their study, students were asked what their personal goals were for school (options were "make good grades", "be popular", and "be good in sports"; `goals`).  These data (and answers to several other questions) are in [PopularKids.csv](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/PopularKids.csv).  Use these data to answer the following questions.

1. How many students from the fourth grade were in the sample?
1. What percentage of the sample were students in the fifth grade and said that their goal was to "be popular"?
1. What percentage of students in the fourth grade said that their goal was to "be good in sports"?
1. What percentage of students in the fifth grade said that their goal was to "make good grades"?
1. What percentage of all students said that their goal was to "make good grades"?
1. What percentage of students that said that their goal was to "be popular" were in the sixth grade.
1. Comment on how the distribution of students into the `goal` categories differs (or not) among grades.
