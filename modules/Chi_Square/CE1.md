## Forest Composition
<img src="../zimgs/forestcomp.jpg" alt="Forest Composition" class="img-right">
Hely *et al.* (2000; Journal of Vegetation Science 11:813-824) examined the effects of stand composition on fire hazard in mixed-wood Canadian boreal forests.  Two variables that they recorded for each stand were stand type (`sttype`, where `d`=deciduous, `c`=coniferous, `mc`=mixed coniferous, and `md`=mixed deciduous) and the time since the last fire (`tslf`) which was treated as a categorical variable with the categories corresponding to 100 year blocks of time (i.e., `0-100`, `100-200`, etc.).  These data may be found in [Fire.csv](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/Fire.csv).  Use these data to determine if the distribution of times since last fire differs by type of forest stand.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).  [Note: **refactor** `sttype` so that the `c` and `d` levels are ordered at the ends (i.e., so that the categories are arranged from mostly coniferous to mostly deciduous).]
