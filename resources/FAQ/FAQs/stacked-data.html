subtitle: How should data from two groups be entered?

<hr />
<p>Suppose that you have data from two groups â€“ heights of male and female students, salaries of CEOs from public and private businesses, or, what I will use here, the number of books owned by science and humanities majors. Further suppose that the data look like this</p>
<pre>
science -- 7,1,3,2
humanities -- 17,12,9,6,15,13
</pre>
<p>It is very common for students to want to enter these data in the following format:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>science</th>
<th>humanities</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>7</td>
<td>17</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>1</td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>13</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>However, this violates the principle that each row should contain information about only one individual. For example, the first row shows the number of books for two individuals, one a science and the other a humanities student. In addition, these data will result in an error about unequal column lengths when loaded into R.</p>
<p>These data should be entered in what is called <strong>stacked</strong> format. In stacked format, the data look like the following.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>type</th>
<th>books</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>science</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>science</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>science</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>science</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>humanities</td>
<td>17</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>humanities</td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>humanities</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>humanities</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>humanities</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>humanities</td>
<td>13</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In this way, each row corresponds to a single individual. For examle, the first row represents a single student, who is in the sciences and has seven books.</p>
<p>See <a href="enter-data.html">this FAQ</a> for how to get (i.e., load) these data into R.</p>
