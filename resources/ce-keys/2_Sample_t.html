</li>
<li>
2-sample t-test because (i) two populations/groups are considered (bought and homemade compost), (ii) a quantitative variable (number germinated) was recorded, and (iii) the samples are independent (there is no known connection between all pairs of bought and homemade individuals.
</li>
<li>
An experimental study with some randomization (placement of containers in the greenhouse).
</li>
<li>
The assumptions are met because (i) the samples are independent (as described above), (ii) <span class="math inline">\(n_{b}+n_{h}\)</span>=18+10=28&gt;15 and the two sample distributions (shown on the handout) are not obviously strongly skewed, and (iii) the variances appear to be equal (Levene’s p-value=0.2414&gt;<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>).

</li>
<li>
It appears that the the number of plants that germinate is significantly lower for the homemage than the bought compost.
</li>
<li>
I am 90% confident that the number of plants that germinated with the bought compost is more than 11.7 plants greater than the number of plants that germinated with the homemade compost.
