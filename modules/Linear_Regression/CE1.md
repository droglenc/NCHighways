## Equation of the Line

For each situation below, identify the (a) response variable, (b) explanatory variable, (c) slope, and (d) intercept; interpret the (e) slope and (f) intercept; (g) construct a valid prediction (and answer the question you construct); and (h) identify what an extrapolation would be.

1. A student recorded the height of suds (mm) in a dishwasher for ten different amounts of soap (g).  The resulting best-fit line was Y=-20.2+12.4*X for 24<Y<80 and 3.5<X<8.0.
1. A farmer estimated the costs required to produce an amount (in tons) of daily livestock food mix.  He recorded costs and amounts for a 20 day period.  The resulting best-fit line was Y=190*X+12075 for 19000<Y<21000 and 36.5<X<42.
1. [Poole and Carpenter (1980)](http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=ZO9800607) used nasal length (*mm multiplied by 10*) to predict nasal width (*mm multiplied by 10*) of Grey Kangaroos (*Macropus fuliginosus*).  The resulting best fit line was Y=0.2876*X+46.451 for 450<X<900 and 180<Y<320.
