## Blood Pressure Study
<img src="../zimgs/bloodpressure.jpg" alt="Blood Pressure" class="img-right">
A student is designing an experiment to determine the simultaneous effects of calcium in the diet and regular exercise on blood pressure.  Some subjects will be given a calcium supplement pill and some will be given a placebo pill.  In addition, some subjects will be required to perform aerobic exercises once a day, whereas others will not.  The researcher has 32 male subjects available that are as similar as possible (similar ages, weights, initial blood pressures, etc.).

1. Explain why this is an observational or experimental study.
1. What is an individual?
1. Identify the response variable, factors, levels, treatments, and replicates.
1. Using R, identify which specific individuals will be allocated to each treatment.

A student wanted to see how far she could hit two brands of softballs with three types of bats.  The three bats were all 34 inches long and weighed 34 ounces.  Four new balls of each brand were placed into a pitching machine in a random order (the student did not now which type of ball was coming).  The distance (in feet) that each ball was hit (if the ball was not hit or was hit very poorly, then it was put back into the pitching machine).
