RStudio can be used on a ChromeBook but the setup is complicated. Some directions that may work for you are [here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/rstudio-desktop-on-a-chromebook-without-crouton-using-new-linux-beta-option/17393), [here](https://github.com/jennybc/operation-chromebook#links-re-r-and-rstudio), and [here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/rstudio-on-a-chromebook/2802). I am not a Chromebook user and this looks endlessly confusing to me.

It is possible, however, to use RStudio on "the cloud" or through a web browser. Doing this will require you to do some of the things that we do in class in a slightly different format, but it will allow you to use your ChromeBook. If you would like to give this a try then e-mail Dr. Ogle, who can then help you set up "RStudio in the cloud."
