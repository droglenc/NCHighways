<h1>How do I make the my document single-spaced??</h1>
<p>The default "spacing" in MS Word 2007 is to 1.15-spacing with an additional 12-pts of space following each paragraph.  This effectively makes multiple lines of code or output (anything with multiple lines separated by hard returns) look like it is double-spaced.  This is not necessary and is a waste of paper in most instances.  This can be easily fixed in MS Word by highlighting the offending text and then selecting the "Line Spacing" option in the "Paragraph" tab (see figure below).  In the ensuing tab, change the line spacing from 1.15 to 1.0 by clicking on 1.0 and then remove the spacing after the paragraphs by selecting the bottom option. </p>
