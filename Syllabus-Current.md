## Grading
### Overall Grade
<img class="img-right" src="img/grading.jpg">
Your grade in this course will be based on a combination of your engagement during class, reflections on in-class activities, outside-of-class writing assignments, and a final reflection paper according to the following weights:

<table class="grader" width="90%">
<tr><th width="16%">Item</th>
<th width="21%">In-class<br>Engagement</th>
<th width="21%">In-Class<br>Reflections</th>
<th width="21%">Out-of-Class<br>Assignments</th>
<th width="21%">Final<br>Reflection</th>
</tr>
<tr><th>Weight</th>
<th>35%</th><th>30%</th><th>20%</th><th>15%</th></tr>

Your letter grade will be assigned from your overall percentage (rounded to a whole number) and the table below.

<table class="tg">
  <tr><td></td><td>A 92-100</td><td>A- 90-91</td></tr>
  <tr><td>B+ 87-89</td><td>B  82-86</td><td>B- 80-81</td></tr>
  <tr><td>C+ 77-79</td><td>C  70-76</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>D+ 67-69</td><td>D  60-66</td><td>F   0-59</td></tr>
</table>


### Engagement

<img class="img-right" src="img/participation.jpg" alt="Participation">
This class is taught in an active learning format and, thus, our time during class is short and precious. The following behaviors are indicative of an active fully participating student:

- Attended the entire class period (including showing up on time).
- Came to class having fully completed the required preparation materials.
- Fully participated in all in-class activities.
- Paid attention during discussions and asked questions as pertinent.
- Collaboratively worked with others when appropriate.
- Followed the [class conduct guidelines](#classroom-conduct-and-academic-integrity).

I will assess your level of participation at the end of each class period with the following rubric.

<div class="container-fluid">
  <table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr class="info"><th>4 points</th><th>3-1 points</th><th>0 points</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Fully (see above) participated in the day's activities. Properly focused at all times.</td><td>Participated in many, but not all, of the day's activities. Focus waned or was inconsistent. Left early or arrived late by between 1-15 mins.</td><td>Very little active participation in the day's activities. Lacked focus. Left early or arrived late by more than 15 mins.</td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<img class="img-right" src="img/studying.jpg" alt="Studying Hours">

As a general rule-of-thumb[^2], you are expected to spend 2-3 hours of time outside of class for each hour in class. However, this course is designed to minimize your out-of-class work. Thus, you should plan on spending approximately 2 hours per week outside of class preparing for each module (i.e., doing the assigned readings, completing out-of-class assignments). **The work required for this course can be completed within this expected amount of time, if that time is without distraction**. If you feel that you are spending an inordinate amount of time prepating for this course please see me or the TA.

### In-Class and Out-of-Class Assignments

<img class="img-right" src="img/homework.png">
In-class reflections and out-of-class assignments will largely be graded based on "completeness" according to the following rubric.

<div class="container-fluid">
  <table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr class="info"><th>4 points</th><th>3-1 points</th><th>0 points</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>All parts of the exercise were completed in full. Work was neat and orderly.</td><td>Some parts of the exercise were either not attempted or were incomplete. Work was not as neat and orderly as it should have been.</td><td>Very little of the exercise was completed or substantial amounts of the work was copied from someone else.</td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

Out-of-class assignments should be typed and should either be printed to hand in at the beginning of the class period where it is due or e-mailed to me prior to the class period where it is due.

### Final Reflection


#### Note About Incomplete Grades
An incomplete grade will be given ONLY under extreme circumstances beyond your control, such as a major illness, and will ONLY be given if you have successfully completed the entire course except for the final exam. This is in accordance with [Northland College policy](https://my.northland.edu/student-policies/academic-policies/#grades){:target="_blank"} (scroll down to "Incomplete Grades").

## Classroom Conduct and Academic Integrity

<img class="img-right" src="img/cell-cheat.jpg" alt="Conduct and Integrity">

My intent is to create a classroom environment where every student feels comfortable and safe to explore, learn and grow. One part of this environment is your conduct within it. My expectations of you are that you will fully participate in the course (see above) and be respectful of all others in the class. At a minimum, I expect you to adhere to the following behaviors:

* Please arrive to class on time. If you arrive late, then take the first available seat as quietly as possible. If you need to leave early, then please sit near the exit.
* Please attend the entire class period. Please take care of your personal needs (e.g., using the restroom) before class so that you can stay focused for the entire class period.
* Please turn off and store out-of-sight cell phones and other electronic devices.
* Please do not engage in side discussions while I or others are speaking to the entire class.
*	Please do not sleep in class -- this behavior is rude and distracting to others (especially the professor).
* Please do not use disrespectful language when addressing others.

Finally, note that the [College's Academic Integrity Statement & Policy](https://my.northland.edu/student-policies/academic-policies/#academic-integrity){:target="_blank"} will be followed in this course. Please make sure that you are familiar with its content.

### Footnotes

[^email]: While I am pretty open-minded and not much of a stickler when it comes to e-mail etiquette, some professors are. And it is always better to send an appropriate rather than an inappropriate e-mail. [Here](https://www.scribendi.com/advice/how_to_email_a_professor.en.html) and [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/04/16/advice-students-so-they-dont-sound-silly-emails-essay) are some good suggestions for e-mailing professors.

[^1]: I believe the research (e.g., [here](http://www.medicaldaily.com/why-using-pen-and-paper-not-laptops-boosts-memory-writing-notes-helps-recall-concepts-ability-268770){:target="_blank"}, [here](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/body/taking-notes-by-hand-could-improve-memory-wt/){:target="_blank"}, and [here](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/writing-and-remembering-why-we-remember-what-we-write.html){:target="_blank"}) that suggests that you are more likely to remember concepts if you hand-write those concepts down, rather than copy-and-pasting or typing the text.

[^2]: General advice for how much time should be spent outside of class for each hour inside of class can be found, among many, [here](https://www.collegeparentcentral.com/2010/02/is-your-college-student-investing-enough-time-studying/){:target="_blank"}, [here](http://classroom.synonym.com/ratio-studying-class-time-college-1075.html){:target="_blank"}, [here](https://www.usu.edu/asc/studysmart/pdf/estimating_study_hours.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and [here](http://collegelife.about.com/od/academiclife/f/How-Much-Time-Should-I-Spend-Studying-In-College.htm){:target="_blank"}.
