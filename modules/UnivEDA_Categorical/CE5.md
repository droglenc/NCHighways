## Popularity in Middle School
<img src="../zimgs/sports_kids_1.jpg" alt="Sports Kids" class="img-right">
[Chase and Drummer (1992)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1439167) examined sports as a social status determinant for children.  In their study, they surveyed 227 boys and 251 girls in grades 4, 5, and 6 from schools in Michigan to determine which criteria were most important in determining personal, female, and male popularity.  In two parts of their study, students were asked what their personal goals were for school (options were "make good grades", "be popular", and "be good in sports"; `goals`) and to rank the importance that "being good in sports" is in defining popularity (1="most important"-4="least important"; `sports`).  These data (and answers to several other questions) are in [PopularKids.csv](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/PopularKids.csv).  Use these data to answer the following questions.

1. Perform a univariate EDA for `goals`.
1. Perform a univariate EDA for `sports`.
1. Perform a univariate EDA for `type` of school.  Does this suggest anything about the way that students were sampled?
