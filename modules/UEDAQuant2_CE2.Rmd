## Shape and Outliers II
<img src="zimgs/commuting.jpg" alt="Commuting" class="img-right">

The [U.S. Census](http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/united-states/quick-facts/all-states/average-commute-time#map) asked individuals 16 years old and older "How long in minutes is your one-way commute to work each day?".  The mean for individuals from each state was computed and is plotted in the histogram below.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, par1=TRUE}
df <- data.frame(time=c(24.2,18.8,24.6,21.3,27.2,24.5,24.8,24.8,29.7,25.9,27,
                        26,20,28,23.2,18.8,19,22.8,24.9,23.3,32,28,24,22.9,
                        23.9,23.1,18,18.1,23.8,26.3,30.4,21.6,31.6,23.6,16.9,
                        23,21,22.5,25.9,23.6,23.5,16.9,24.3,25,21.4,22.2,27.7,
                        25.7,25.5,21.7,18.3))
hist(~time,data=df,breaks=seq(16,32,2),xaxt="n",xlab="Mean Commute Time (mins)")
axis(1,seq(16,32,2))
```

Use this histogram to answer these questions.

1. What is the shape of this distribution.
1. Are there any outliers represented in this distribution?
1. Which measures would you use to describe the center and dispersion of this distribution?

## Shape and Outliers III
<img src="zimgs/Dungeness.jpg" alt="Dungeness Crab" class="img-right">

Scientists were concered about the overexploitation of Dungeness Crabs (**) in some California waters. To better manage this species they examined the post-molt carapace length from a large sample of crabs. Their results are displayed in the histogram below.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, par1=TRUE}
df <- read.table("http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~statlabs/data/crabs.data",header=TRUE)
hist(~postsz,data=df,w=10,xlab="Post-Molt Carapace Size (mm)")
```

Use this histogram to answer these questions.

1. What is the shape of this distribution.
1. Are there any outliers represented in this distribution?
1. Which measures would you use to describe the center and dispersion of this distribution?
