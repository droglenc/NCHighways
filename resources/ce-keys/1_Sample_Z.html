<li>
1-sample Z-test because (i) one population (bladder cancer patients that received the placebo) was sampled, (ii) a quantitative variable (time of recurrence) was recorded, and (iii) <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is assumed to be known (=15).
</li>
<li>
Loosely an “experiment” as the subjects were given a placebo treatment. There is no obvious randomization apparent in this study.
</li>
<li>
The assumptions are met because (i) <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is known (=15) and (ii) n=42&gt;30.

<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>=31.7 months.

<li>
Reject <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}\)</span> because the p-value&lt;<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
It appears that the time of recurrence for the tumor for ALL patients that received the placebo is greater than the hypothesized 27 months.
</li>
<li>
I am 90% confident that the time of recurrence for the tumor for ALL patients that received the placebo is greater than 28.73 months.

<li>
A one-sample Z-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (number of raptors) was measured, (ii)the individuals are from one population (all years at Hawk’s Ridge), and (iii) <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is known (=37000). Thus, the population mean is being compared to a specific value in the null hypothesis.
</li>
<li>
An observational sample of years that was not random was taken.

The assumptions are met because <span class="math inline">\(n=32&gt;30\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is known.
