## Playing Time Among NHL Rookies
<img src="zimgs/nhlhockey.jpg" alt="Hockey" class="img-right">
Two Northland students were interested in whether the average amount of playing time (mins) per game for NHL rookies differed between those that were drafted straight from college or those that were drafted from professional leagues (minors or European).  To answer this question they generated a random sample of 25 rookies from colleges and 25 rookies from professional leagues.

## Public Attitudes Towards Wolves in Wisconsin
<img src="zimgs/wiwolf.jpg" alt="Wolf" class="img-right">
[Hogberg *et al.* (2013)](http://faculty.nelson.wisc.edu/treves/wolves/reports/hogberg_treves_shaw_naughton_2013surveyreport.pdf) were interested in determining if public attitudes towards wolves had changed following the 2012 wolf harvest (the first legal harvest of wolves in Wisconsin).  The researchers obtained surveys from 773 residents of Wisconsin that had participated in three previous surveys.  Most questions used a five-point agreement scale of "Strongly Agree", "Agree", "Neutral", "Disagree", or "Strongly Disagree".  Among other things, the researchers were interested in determining if the percent of respondents who either agreed or strongly agreed with "*In general, the DNR is responsive to the concerns of most Wisconsin citizens.*" had increased following the wolf harvest.
