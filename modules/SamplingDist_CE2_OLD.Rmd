## Checking the CLT
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/zimgs/computer-1.jpg" alt="Simulations" class="img-right">
You can develop evidence to support (or not) the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) by (i) creating a known population, (ii) stating your expectations for the sampling distribution of the means from the CLT, (iii) repeatedly sampling from the population to construct a simulated sampling distribution of the means, (iv) recording results from the repeated samplings, and (v) comparing the observed results to what you expected from the CLT.

The `cltSim()` function (with no arguments) from `NCStats` provides an efficient method to create a known population, repeatedly sample (5000 times) from that population, and summarize the resulting simulated sampling distribution.  For example, `cltSim()` produced the plots shown below.  The histogram on the left is a known population distribution with the parameters (&mu; &amp; &sigma;) shown.  The histogram on the right is a simulated sampling distribution; i.e., the distribution of means from 5000 samples of size n from the known population.  In RStudio, this plot will have a gear icon in the upper-left corner that will open a dialog box that allows you to modify n.  Additionally, you can control two shape parameters that will alter the known population distribution.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=7,fig.height=3,par2=TRUE}
cltSim()
```

The table below can be used to efficiently record your expectations and observed results for different sample sizes.

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
<thead>
<tr><th></th><th colspan=3 class="text-center">Expected from CLT</th><th colspan=3 class="text-center">Observed from <code>cltSim()</code></th></tr>
<tr><th>n=</th><th class="text-center">Shape</th><th class="text-center">Center</th><th class="text-center">Dispersion</th><th class="text-center">Shape</th><th class="text-center">Center</th><th class="text-center">Dispersion</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>10</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Use `cltSim()` and the table above to answer the following questions.

1. Construct a population distribution where `shape1=1` and `shape2=1`.
    1. What is the shape, center, and dispersion of this population?
    1. What would you *expect*, based on the CLT (*not* the results from `cltSim()`), the sampling distribution of the sample means to look like for n=10, 25, and 50.  Record your expectations in the appropriate cells of the table above.
    1. What did you *observe* (from `cltSim()`) for the simulated sampling distributions of the sample means for n=10, 25, and 50.  Record your observations in the appropriate cells of the table above.
    1. Did each of your observations match your expectations?  Does this give you confidence in the CLT?
1. Repeat for `shape=1` and `shape2=5`.
1. Repeat for `shape=5` and `shape2=3`.
