<h2>Mean vs Median</h2>
<ol>
<li>NA</li>
<li>The mean is greater than the median for right-skewed distributions, less than the median for left-skewed distributions, and approximately equal to the median for approximately symmetric distributions.</li>
<li>Outliers attract the mean but have little effect on the median. For example, if the outlier is at the maximum value then the mean will be greater than the median.</li>
<li>See below.
<ol>
<li>Mean &gt; Median</li>
<li>Mean &lt; Median (only slightly)</li>
<li>Mean &gt; Median</li>
<li>Mean = Median (approximately)</li>
<li>Mean = Median (approximately)</li>
<li>Mean &lt; Median</li>
<li>Mean &lt; Median</li>
<li>Mean = Median (approximately)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The mean uses the actual values whereas the median is only concerned with relative positions.</li>

<h2>Coarse Woody Debris</h2>
<ol>
<li>
The diameter of CWD is largely right-skewed with a separate group of four individuals at higher diameters (Figure 1). With this definition of shape, there are no outliers. The center as measured by the median is 18 cm and the IQR is from a Q1 of 16.25 to a Q3 of 20.75 cm (Table 1). I chose to use the median and IQR because of the right-skewed shape.

The diameter of CWD is largely right-skewed for both low- and medium-exposure sites (Figure 2). There are no obvious outliers. [<i>Note that it is difficult to describe shape and outliers in this case because the sample sizes in the two groups are so small.</i>] The medians are 19 and 18, respectively, for the low- and medium-exposure sites (Table 2). The IQR is from a Q1 of 16 to a Q3 of 24 for the low-exposure sites and from a Q1 of 17 to a Q3 of 20 for the medium-exposure sites (Table 2). The median and IQR were used because of the skewed shape for both distributions.

<h2>Cafe Sales</h2>
<ol>
<li>
The distribution of coffees sold was right-skewed with a hint of bimodality (a small peak near 10 coffees sold and a taller peak near 30 coffees sold), but no obvious outliers (Figure 3). The center as measured by the median was 23 coffees sold and the IQR was from a Q1 of 12 to a Q3 of 30 coffees sold (Table 3). I chose to use the median and IQR to measure center and dispersion because of the skewed shape.

In general, slightly more coffees were sold in the middle of the week (Table 4). There was slightly less variability on Mondays (Table 4). [<i>I did not make histograms for each different day of the week because the sample sizes for each day were small (&lt;=10).</i>]

<li>
The distribution of sodas sold was primarily symmetric with no obvious outliers (Figure 4). The center as measured by the mean was 29.6 sodas sold and the dispersion as measured by the standard deviation was 11.9 sodas sold (Table 5). I chose to use the mean and standard deviation to measure center and dispersion because of the symmetric shape and lack of outliers.
