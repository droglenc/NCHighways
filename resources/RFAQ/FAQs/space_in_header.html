<h1>The <font face="Courier New" color="#FF0000">read.table()</font> says that "line X did not have Y elements"</h1>
<p>This error typically looks like this ...</p>

<pre>
<font color="#FF0000">> d1 <- read.table("Ex1_spaces.txt",header=T)</font>
<font color="#0000FF">Error in scan(file, what, nmax, sep, dec, quote, skip, nlines, na.strings,  : 
        line 1 did not have 4 elements</font></pre>

<p>... and is caused by two main mistakes -- (1) names in the header contain spaces or (2) data rows have missing values.</p>

<hr width="80%" size="5">
<p>First, one or more of the header names contains spaces.  This causes a problem because R considers the text file to be a new column following each "white space" that it finds.  For example, consider the following file (the file attempted to be read above) ...</p>

<pre>First Name      Last Name
Derek   Ogle
Young   Kim
Jefry   Johnson</pre>

<p>R will consider this file to have four column names ("First", "Name", "Last", and "Name") because each of these names in the header row is separated by white space.  Thus, R expects four columns of data in the data rows.  However, the following data rows only have two items each.  This discrepance leads to the error of this FAQ.  This problem can be corrected by making sure that the header names do not contain spaces.  If some sort of separation is desired than use a period in the place of the space.  The following data file can be read into R correctly.</p>

<pre>
First.Name      Last.Name
Derek   Ogle
Young   Kim
Jefry   Johnson
</pre>

<hr width="80%" size="5">
<p>Second, one or more of the data rows contains missing data that was not declared with the "NA" value.  Missing values in R must be explicitly defined by including a "NA" (for "not available") in the position of the missing value.  If the missing value is left as a blank then R does not think enough data has been supplied leading to the error of this FAQ.  For example, consider the following file ...</p>

<pre>
First.Name      Last.Name
Derek   Ogle
Young
Jefry   Johnson
</pre>

<p>Note that the second value in the second data row is missing.  This row will look like it only has one data element rather than two.  This problem can be corrected by making sure that an "NA" is placed in the position of the missing data.  The following data file can be read into R correctly.</p>

<pre>
First.Name      Last.Name
Derek   Ogle
Young	NA
Jefry   Johnson
</pre>
