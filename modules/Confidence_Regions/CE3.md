## Body Temperature
<img src="../zimgs/body-temperature-2.png" alt="Body Temperature" class="img-right">
[Machowiak (1992)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1302471)[^1] provided a critical examination of whether normal body temperature was 37<sup>o</sup>C.  They recorded the orally-determined body temperatures of 65 male and 65 female subjects.  Their data is found in NormTemp.csv ([file](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/NormTemp.csv), [meta](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/blob/master/NormTemp_meta.txt)).  Use this information to (i) construct an appropriate confidence region assuming that &alpha;=0.05 and that &sigma;=0.41, and (ii) summarize your findings in terms of body temperatures.

## Radius of Jupiter
<img src="../zimgs/jupiter.jpg" alt="Jupiter" class="img-right">
Researchers measured the equatorial radius of [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter) 40 different times.  The method used is largely without bias but there is measurement-to-measurement variability.  In fact, &sigma; is assumed to be 28 km.  The mean of the 40 measurements was 71492 km.  From this, (i) construct an appropriate confidence interval assuming that &alpha;=0.01 and (ii) specifically interpret your findings.[^2]
