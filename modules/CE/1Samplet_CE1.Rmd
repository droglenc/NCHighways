## P-Value Calculations and Decisions I

For each situation below, (i) compute the t test statistic, (ii) compute the p-value (include a drawing to support your calculation), and (iii) make a decision about H<sub>0</sub>.

1. &alpha;=0.05, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;&ne;14, n=25, s=6.1, x&#772;=11.2.
1. &alpha;=0.10, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;>75, n=50, s=11.7, x&#772;=79.5.

## Confidence Interval Calculations I

For the same situations above, (a) identify the level of confidence; (b) whether a lower confidence bound, upper confidence bound, or confidence interval should be constructed; (c) find t<sup>*</sup> (include a drawing that illustrates your calculation); (d) construct the confidence region; and (e) specifically interpret the confidence region.

## Fecal Coliform Counts I
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/zimgs/warning_sign.jpg" alt="Checking out" class="img-right">
[Fecal coliform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_coliform) is a bacterium that originates in the intestines of warm-blooded animals and, thus, may be found in their feces.  Organic matter containing fecal coliform may be washed into lakes and streams in runoff following large rain events.  In lakes and streams, the fecal coliform may lead to the growth of pathogens that are dangerous to the health of humans, or reduce oxygen available to fish and other aquatic life.  Thus, fecal coliform levels are routinely monitored in many waterbodies in the United States.

Students recorded fecal coliform counts (number of colony forming units (CFU) per 100 ml) in water samples from a nearby lake following a rainstorm that resulted in considerable runoff.  The results from their samples are shown below.

```{r echo=FALSE, par1=TRUE}
df <- read.csv("FecalColiform.csv")
Summarize(~CFU,data=df,digits=2)
hist(~CFU,data=df,xlab="Colony Forming Units per 100 ml")
```

Test, at the 5% level, if these results differ from the mean of 178 CFU/100ml predicted by a computer model.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../11-steps).

## Fecal Coliform Counts II
The students' data was recorded in [FecalColiform.csv](FecalColiform.csv).  Use the data in this file to confirm your calculations above.

## Acid Rain in Shenandoah National Park
<img src="zimgs/rose-river-falls.jpg" alt="Shenandoah National Park" class="img-right">

The pH scales falls between 0 and 14 with values <7 considered acidic and values >7 considered basic. Rain water is naturally acidic, usually around 5.6 on the pH scale. Thus, the EPA defines rainwater with a pH less than 5.6 as being "acid rain." A series of rain collection samples were taken at the Big Meadows Station in the Shenandoah National Park, VA with the results stored in pHlevels.csv ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/pHlevels.csv), [meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/pHlevels_meta.txt)). Use these data to determine, at the 1% level, if there is evidence for "acid rain" at this site. [*Note: This question originated from [here](http://www.cvgs.k12.va.us/DIGSTATS/main/inferant/a_acidrain.htm).*]
