## Urban Runoff
<img src="zimgs/no-dumping-drains-to-ocean.jpg" alt="No Dumping" class="img-right">
Urbanization poses a major threat to stream and watershed ecosystems.  One aspect of urbanization is the conversion of natural areas to land with impervious surfaces, thus increasing runoff of rain and, likely, pollutants.  A University of Washington researcher recorded the percent of impervious land and the benthic index of biotic integrity (IBI) for 14 areas in the state of Washington.  The IBI has been described as a measure of "the capability of supporting and maintaining a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organisms having a species composition and functional organization comparable to that of natural habitat in the region."  In this example, the researchers were attempting to identify how the percentage of impervious surfaces in the area effects the IBI.  The data for this study are below (*FYI, much more information can be obtained at the [QELP site](http://www.seattlecentral.edu/qelp/sets/077/077.html#About)*).

<pre>
imperv   60 43 43 34 27 25 21 18 11  8  8  8  7  7  5  4  2
IBI       9 11 13 23 31 31 21 23 27 37 39 29 31 43 33 35 37
</pre>

Load these data into R to answer the questions below.

1. What is the response variable?
1. What is the explanatory variable?
1. Describe the relationship between IBI and the percent of impervious area (i.e., perform a bivariate EDA).
