## Chemical Waste Disposal
<img src="../zimgs/waste-disposal.jpg" alt="Chemical Waste Disposal" class="img-right">

In June 2000, facilities management at the University of Massachusetts-Boston surveyed lab managers at the University regarding chemical waste disposal. One question that they asked the survey participants was, "Which federal agency regulates the disposal of chemical wastes: Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Transportation, or National Institutes of Health?" The individual responses for this survey are shown below by showing the first letter corresponding to each participant's category choice. Note that one participant did not answer this question and is labeled with a "U" for "unanswered." Enter these data into a CSV file and load into R.
