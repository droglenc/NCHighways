## Sign Legibility and Age
<img src="zimgs/blurredsign.jpg" alt="Blurred Sign" class="img-right">
In a study of the legibility and visibility of highway signs, a Pennsylvania research firm determined the maximum distance at which each of 30 drivers could read a newly designed sign. The participants in the study were from 18 to 82 years old. The government agency that funded the research hoped to improve highway safety for older drivers and wanted to examine the relationship between age and sign legibility distance. Use the data in vision.csv ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/vision.csv), [meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/vision_meta.txt)) to construct results that can be used to answer the questions below. [*Example from [Utts and Heckard, Mind on Statistics](http://www.cengage.com/c/mind-on-statistics-5e-utts)*].

1. What is the response variable? [*Hint: Read the rest of the questions before answering this question.*]
1. What is the explanatory variable?
1. In terms of the variables of this problem, what is the equation of the best-fit line?
1. In terms of the variables of this problem, interpret the value of the slope.
1. In terms of the variables of this problem, interpret the value of the intercept.
1. What is the predicted maximum distance to see the sign for a 40-year-old driver?
1. What is the predicted maximum distance to see the sign for a 90-year-old driver
1. What is the residual if the age of the driver is 50 and the maximum distance is 410 ft?
1. What is the correlation coefficient between age and maximum distance to see the sign?
1. What proportion of the variability in maximum distance to see the sign is explained by knowing the age of the driver?
1. How much will the predicted maximum distance to see the sign change if the driver's age increased by ten years?
1. What aspect of this regression analysis concerns you? [*Hint: consider the regression assumptions*]?
