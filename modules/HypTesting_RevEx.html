In a nutshell, because of sampling variability. It is possible that the sample consisted of mostly individuals with large values even if the actual distribution was centered on the hypothesized value (i.e., 11). In other words, one must formally account for sampling variability, which is done by making the p-value calculation from a sampling distribution.

<h2>BOD in Effluent</h2>

<p>The managers of a wastewater treatment plant monitored the amount of biological oxygen demand (BOD; lbs/day) in the effluent of the plant each month from January 1991 to October 2000. The managers would need to take corrective actions if the average BOD over this time period was significantly greater than 2200 lbs/day at a 10% rejection level. Previous studies indicated that the standard deviation was 1200 lbs/day. Summary statistics from their sample of days is given below. Use this information to answer the questions below.</p>

The classic example deals with the population dynamics of an animal. The null hypothesis says that the animal’s population size is not declining, it is remaining stable over time. The alternative hypothesis is that the animal’s population is declining. If the null hypothesis is true and you reject it (i.e., you say the population is declining when it really isn’t) you have made a type I error. This will likely lead resource managers to take actions to protect the animal. This is not necessarily a bad thing for the animal, although it may be costly. Conversely, if the null hypothesis is false and you fail to reject it (i.e., the animal is really declining but you say that it isn’t), then you have made a type II error. This is much more egregious mistake because now you will take no action to protect the animal; it may go extinct. To me, losing an animal is much more costly (important) than overprotecting the animal.
