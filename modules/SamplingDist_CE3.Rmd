## Checking the CLT
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/zimgs/computer-1.jpg" alt="Simulations" class="img-right">
You can develop evidence to support (or not) the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) by (i) creating a known population, (ii) stating your expectations for the sampling distribution of the means from the CLT, (iii) repeatedly sampling from the population to construct a simulated sampling distribution of the means, (iv) recording results from the repeated samplings, and (v) comparing the observed results to what you expected from the CLT.

The `cltSim()` function (with no arguments) from `NCStats` provides an efficient method to create a known population, repeatedly sample (5000 times) from that population, and summarize the resulting simulated sampling distribution. For example, `cltSim()` produced the plots shown below. The histogram on the left is a known population distribution with the parameters (&mu; &amp; &sigma;) shown. The histogram on the right is a simulated sampling distribution; i.e., the distribution of means from 5000 samples of size n from the known population. In RStudio, this plot will have a gear icon in the upper-left corner that will open a dialog box that allows you to modify n. Additionally, you can control two shape parameters that will alter the known population distribution.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=7,fig.height=3,par2=TRUE}
cltSim()
```

Each situation below corresponds to the situation on the [previous exercise](SamplingDist_CE2.html). Here you will first use `cltSim()` to take samples from the given population, use those samples to create a sampling distribution along with its summary statistics, and record your observations about the shape (normal or not), center (a specific value), and dispersions (a specific value) of the sampling distribution. You will then be asked to compare your observations (here) to what you expected based on the CLT (on the previous exercise).

## Situation 1
The population is constructed by using `shape1=1` and `shape2=1` in `cltSim()`.

1. What did you observed about the sampling distribution of the sample means for each of n=10, 25, and 50. Record your observations in the appropriate cells of the table below.

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed" style="width:65%">
<thead>
<tr><th></th><th colspan=3 class="text-center">Observed from <code>cltSim()</code></th></tr>
<tr><th>n=</th><th class="text-center">Normal?</th><th class="text-center">Center</th><th class="text-center">Dispersion</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>10</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

1. Did each of your observations match your expectations? Does this give you confidence in the CLT?

## Situation 2
The population is constructed by using `shape1=1` and `shape2=5` in `cltSim()`.

1. What did you observed about the sampling distribution of the sample means for each of n=10, 25, and 50. Record your observations in the appropriate cells of a table like that above.
1. Did each of your observations match your expectations? Does this give you confidence in the CLT?

## Situation 3
The population is constructed by using `shape1=5` and `shape2=3` in `cltSim()`.

1. What did you observed about the sampling distribution of the sample means for each of n=10, 25, and 50. Record your observations in the appropriate cells of a table like that above.
