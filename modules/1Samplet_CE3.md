## Increased Civility in Nation-States?
<img src="zimgs/scales-of-justice.jpg" alt="Scales of Justice" class="img-right">
Common wisdom has it that the world is becoming more civilized.  This would suggest that nation-states are killing fewer of their citizens (including capital punishment, deaths in civil and international wars, and all state-sponsored violence) than was once the case.  An analysis of history textbooks suggests that, in a typical year in the nineteenth century, the mean number of citizens killed by the typical nation-state was 4,104.  To examine if the world is becoming more civilized, the number of deaths from state-sponsored violence was recorded from records in the archives of [Amnesty International](http://www.amnestyusa.org/), [The International Court of Justice](http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/), the [United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/index.html), and [The World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/) for a random sample of 75 countries.  The mean and standard deviation for number of killings in these 75 countries was 3,292.8 and 4,814.5, respectively.  Use these results to determine, at the 5% level, if the "world is becoming more civilized."  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](11-steps).[^1]
