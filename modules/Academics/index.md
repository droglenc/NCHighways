<p>Academic success should be the central focus of a studentâ€™s college experience. Academics are the reason students attend college and their performance in this arena can set them up for long-term success in their lives and careers. But as any college student can attest, doing college work takes a lot more, and a different type of effort than high school. The timing is flipped, to where students spend much less time IN class and are expected to do much more work OUT of class. On average, they should expect to spend 2-3 hours of time working on their own for every 1 hour spent in class, which is much different than what most students experience in high school. Too often, college faculty expect students to just know how to study or to figure it out on their own. In reality, it is critical that students be introduced to the tools to be successful in their academic endeavors. The purpose of this unit is to help students understand their existing study habits, as well as developing new skills that are perhaps more applicable to college-level academic work. Students will have the opportunity to practice reading, taking notes, asking questions in order to ensure long-term success in college.</p>
