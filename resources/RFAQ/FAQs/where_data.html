<h1>Where are the data files that Prof. Ogle provides for us?</h1>
<p>Many times I will refer to data files that I have made available to you or, in the text, it will mention a file name with a ".txt" extension.  These files are available from the <a href="../Data/Data.html">Local Downloadable Data Files</a> link on the <a href="../R.html">R Resources webpage</a>.  These files can be downloaded by right-clicking on them and saving them to your disk.  They are then loaded into R with <font face="Courier New" color="#FF0000">read.table()</font>.</p>
