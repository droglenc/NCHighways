Use `snorm()` from `NCStats` to answer the following questions.

1. Describe what happens to the normal distribution if &mu; is increased?
1. Describe what happens to the normal distribution if &sigma; is increased?

## Normal Distribution Characteristics II

For each situation below, (i) identify &mu;, (ii) identify &sigma;, and (iii) draw the normal distribution with an approximately accurate scale on the x-axis.

1. X~N(75,10)
1. Y~N(5500,600)
1. Z~N(0,1)
