<li>
Chi-square test because (i) two or more populations (stand types) were sampled and (ii) the response variable (time since last fire) is categorial (in the way it was recorded).
</li>
<li>
This is an observational study because the stand type was not set or manipulated by the researcher. The stands were not obviously randomly selected.
</li>
<li>
All cells in the expected frequency table (Table 1) were NOT greater than 5. The p-value calculation below is suspect.

It appears that the distribution of stands into the times since last fire differs among at least one pair of the stand types. Analysis of the row percentage table (Table 4) suggests the time since last fire increases as one moves from primarily deciduous to primarily coniferous stands.
