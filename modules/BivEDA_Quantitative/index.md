<div class="ILOs">
<p>It is important to understand the relationship between two variables.  With quantitative data, this primarily consists of using a scatterplot and the correlation coefficient to describe four key characteristics of the relationship.  This module describes how to construct a scatterplot, calculate a correlation coefficient, and how to use these results to prepare a synthetic description of the relationship between two quantitative variables.</p>

<p>After completing this module, you should be able to ...</p>

<ol>
  <li>Construct a scatterplot with R.</li>
  <li>Know when it is appropriate to calculation a correlation coefficient.</li>
  <li>Calculate a correlation coefficient with R.</li>
  <li>Construct a succinct written summary that addresses the four key characteristics (form, direction, outliers, and strength) of the relationship between two quantitative variables.</li>
</ol>

* Watch ["What is the Correlation"](https://www.youtube.com/v/PtYVrF_WT3A?version=3&start=32&autoplay=1){:target="_blank"} [8 mins]
* Watch ["Bivariate EDA (Quantitative) in R"](https://vimeo.com/user45324800/biveda-quant){:target="_blank"} [8 mins]
    * Take notes on [this handout](RHO.html){:target="_blank"} (or [![PDF](../../img/pdf.png)](RHO.pdf) or [![MSWord](../../img/word.png)](RHO.docx))
