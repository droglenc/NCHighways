    <div class="panel-body">Feeling connected to the local community and local landscapes is part of a full college experience. Students who develop a strong connection and belonging to where they are are more likely to persist to graduation. Northern Wisconsin is a rich tapestry woven together by human and ecological influences, past and present. Helping cultivate your awareness and connection to this tapestry is the focus of this module. Student guides from the Sigurd Olson Environmental Institute will lead you on an outing to a local area where you will have an opportunity to experience nature, connect with the local landscape, and interact with peers in new ways.
<br><br>
