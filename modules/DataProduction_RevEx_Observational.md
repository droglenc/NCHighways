        <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#SWIH">The National Institutes of Health (NIH) established the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) in 1991 to address the most common causes of death, disability and impaired quality of life in postmenopausal women. The WHI addressed cardiovascular disease, cancer, and osteoporosis. The WHI was a 15 year multi-million dollar endeavor, and one of the largest U.S. prevention studies of its kind. One aspect of the WHI enlisted 93,676 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 from 40 Clinical Centers from throughout the United States (see <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/whi/whict.htm#map">this map</a>). The women were not asked to take any medication or change their health habits. The health of participants was tracked over an average of eight years by periodically asking the women to complete health forms. What type of study is this?</a>

      <div class="panel-body">Observational study; a convenience sample in regards to the selection of the clinics and a voluntary response in regards to the subjects.  Overall, I would call it a voluntary response sample as the individuals of the study are the subjects.

        <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#SDOT">The U.S. Department of Transportation sponsored a study to determine the transportation patterns and motivations for driving among offenders before, during, and after suspension of their driver's license for an alcohol-related offense (more information <a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/research/observation_study/index.htm">here</a>.). The travel patterns for each subject were examined for two four-hour periods during the last month of the suspension period (one observation Monday-Thursday 6 - 10 a.m. and the other observation Friday or Saturday evening 6 - 10 p.m.; actual days were randomly selected). These observation periods were selected to include a time period when the subject would likely be traveling to work and a time period when the subject would likely be traveling for personal, recreational, or social reasons. Similar examinations were conducted at least one month after drivers had had their license reinstated. These post-suspension observations were conducted for each subject at the same times of day and days of the week as the during-suspension observations. What type of study is this?</a>

      <div class="panel-body">Observational study; a convenience sample in regards to selecting the subjects but a random sample in regards to the times observed.  Overall, I would call this a random sample as the time periods are the individual of interest (although, any inferences will only pertain to the set of subjects observed in this study).

        <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#Pines">I have noticed that the needles of white pine trees near major highways are brown. I hypothesized that this may be caused by increased levels of carbon monoxide (CO; ppm) and salt (ppt) near the roads. I am considering two studies to test this hypothesis. First, at two types of sites -- near highways and far from highways -- I will count the number of trees that are mostly brown and measure levels of CO and salt. Second, I will determine the effect of CO and salt levels by growing 20 randomly-selected nearly-identical seedlings in pots that only differ in the levels of CO and salt -- 0 and 5 ppm CO and 0 and 4 ppt salt. Which study is an observational study? Which study will provide a definitive answer to the stated hypothesis?</a>

    <div id="Genetics2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">The first study is the observational study because no conditions are imparted onto the pine trees (in the second study the seedlings are given CO and salt amounts). The experimental (second) study will provide a definitive answer to my hypothesis because it is the only type of study from which ``causal'' statements can be made.  In the experiment, all other variables were controlled for except for the two that I was interested in.  In the observational study, other variables may be responsible for any effect observed.
