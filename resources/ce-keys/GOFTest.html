<h2>Preference for Bottled Water?</h2>
<ol>
<li>
α=0.01.
</li>
<li>
H<sub>A</sub>: “There is a preference among the water choices (i.e., the distribution of students will NOT follow a theoretical distribution of equal proportions among the water choices)” and H<sub>O</sub>: “There is no preference among the water choices (i.e., the distribution of students will follow a theoretical distribution of equal proportions among the water choices)”.
</li>
<li>
Goodness-of-fit test because (i) one population (students) were sampled and (ii) the response variable (water choice) is categorial.
</li>
<li>
This is quasi-experimental as the students were given a choice of only certain waters. The students were not obviously randomly selected (and were likely part of a voluntary response survey).
</li>
<li>
All cells in the expected frequency table (Table 1) were greater than 5; the assumptions for a goodness-of-fit test have been met.
</li>
<p>Table 1: Expected frequency of students (assuming that Ho is true) by water type choice.</p>
<pre><code>     tap Aquafina     Fiji     Sams 
   26.75    26.75    26.75    26.75 </code></pre>
<li>
The observed frequency table is shown in Table 2.
</li>
<p>Table 2: Observed frequency of students by water type choice.</p>
<pre><code>     tap Aquafina     Fiji     Sams 
      51       18       17       21 </code></pre>
<li>
χ<sup>2</sup>=29.6355 with 3 df (Table 3).
</li>
<p>Table 3: Goodness-of-fit test results for testing that the distribution of students was the same among water type choices.</p>
<pre><code>Chi-squared test for given probabilities with w.obs 
X-squared = 29.6355, df = 3, p-value = 1.646e-06</code></pre>
<li>
p-value=&lt;0.00005 (Table 3).
</li>
<li>
Reject H<sub>0</sub> because the p-value&lt;α.
</li>
<li>
It appears that there is a preference for water type by the students. Analysis of the percentage table (Table 4) suggests that the students preferred the tap water.
</li>
<p>Table 4: Percentage table for water type choices by the students.</p>
<pre><code>     tap Aquafina     Fiji     Sams      Sum 
    47.7     16.8     15.9     19.6    100.0 </code></pre>
<li>
Not necessary with a chi-square test.
