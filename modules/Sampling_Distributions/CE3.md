## Melatonin and Sleep
<img src="../zimgs/melatonin.png" alt="melatonin" class="img-right">
MIT researchers examined the effect of [melatonin](http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/tc/melatonin-overview) on sleep.  Suppose that we know that men given a placebo fell asleep according to a N(15,5) distribution.  For each question below identify (a) the distribution that would be used to answer the question, (b) whether the question can be answered or not, (c) specific characteristics of the required distribution, and (d) if appropriate, the answer to the question.

1. What is the probability, with 4 randomly selected men, of observing a mean of more than 12 mins?
1. What is the probability that a randomly selected man will fall asleep in more than 12 mins?
1. What is the probability that 25 randomly selected will have a mean time to fall asleep of more than 15.5 minutes?

## Pollutants in Auto Exhaust

The level of nitrogen oxides (NOX) in the exhaust of a particular car model is right-skewed with a mean of 0.9 grams per mile (g/mi) and a standard deviation of 0.15 g/mi.  For each question below identify (a) the distribution that would be used to answer the question, (b) whether the question can be answered or not, (c) specific characteristics of the required distribution, and (d) if appropriate, the answer to the question.

1. What is the probability that a car will have a NOX greater than 1 g/mi?
1. What is the probability that a random sample of 15 cars will have a mean NOX greater than 1 g/mi?
1. What is the probability that a random sample of 50 cars will have a mean NOX greater than 0.92 g/mi?
1. What is the probability that a random sample of 50 cars will have a mean NOX less than 0.85 g/mi?
1. What is the mean NOX such that only 1% of samples of 50 cars have a larger mean?
