The scatterplot below illustrates the relationship between the percent of female Kingfishers and the latitude of the survey.</p>
<p><img src="CE1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" title="" alt="" width="480" /></p>
<p>Use this scatterplot to answer these questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is an individual in this example?</li>
<li>What types of variables are the two variables used here?</li>
<li>What was the maximum latitude examined?</li>
<li>What was the minimum percent of females observed?</li>
<li>What are the values for both variables for the point at the very top of the plot?</li>
<li>How many surveys recorded fewer than 30% female Kingfishers?</li>
<li>How many surveys were between 40 and 45<sup>o</sup>N?</li>
<li>What is the association exhibited in this plot?</li>
</ol>
