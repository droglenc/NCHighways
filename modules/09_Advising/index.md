    <div class="panel-body">A four-year plan is a map of when you plan to take courses that are required for the Liberal Education for the Environment and Society (LEES), your major(s), and, optionally, your minor(s) curricula. The four-year plan will also show you that you have "time" to take other courses that may interest you. A four-year plan will also help you be prepared for your biannual "registration advising" meeting with your academic advisor. In this module, you will complete the four-year plan that you began in the last module.
