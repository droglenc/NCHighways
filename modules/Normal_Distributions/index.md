<div class="ILOs">
<p>Many natural phenomena can be closely approximated by simple statistical distributions.  The most common of these distributions is the normal distribution, most often referred to by laypeople as the "bell-shaped curve."  Because of its prevalence, the normal distribution is the foundation of many statistical methods.  This module describes how to make calculations with a normal distribution.  These calculations are useful in their own right, but they also form the foundation for many of the methods used in later modules.</p>

<p>After completing this module, you should be able to ...</p>

<ol>
  <li>Describe the shape, center, and dispersion of a normal distribution.</li>
  <li>Explain the physical characteristics of a normal distribution that are represented by the mean and standard deviation.</li>
  <li>Estimate percentages of individuals and values of variables using the 68-95-99.7 Rule.</li>
  <li>Identify the difference between "forward" and "reverse" types of calculations.</li>
  <li>Accurately make "forward" calculations with R.</li>
  <li>Accurately make "reverse" calculations with R.</li>
</ol>

You should prepare for the concepts of this module by *reading Sections XXX* in [the textbook](../../book/) and watching the following videos:

* Watch "68-95-99.7 Rule" [A](https://www.youtube.com/v/PJPXFOK8F8E?version=3&autoplay=1){:target="_blank"} [9 mins] **or** [B](https://www.youtube.com/v/cgxPcdPbujI?version=3&autoplay=1){:target="_blank"} [8 mins]
* Watch ["Forward Calculations in R"](https://vimeo.com/user45324800/normdist-forward){:target="_blank"} [6 mins]
    * Take notes on [this handout](RHO.html){:target="_blank"} (or [![PDF](../../img/pdf.png)](RHO.pdf) or [![MSWord](../../img/word.png)](RHO.docx))
    * [R Script](RHO.R){:target="_blank"}
* Watch ["Reverse Calculations in R"](https://vimeo.com/user45324800/normdist-reverse){:target="_blank"} [6 mins]
    * Take notes on the same handout.

Questions XXX in [the textbook](../../book/) will assess your understanding of these materials.
