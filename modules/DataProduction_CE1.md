## Study Types I
For each question below, identify (and explain why) whether it represents an observational or experimental study.

1. [Stoll *et al.* (1999)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10232294) followed 30 people with bipolar disorder over a 4‐month period.  Patients who were given a high dose (10 g/day) of omega‐3 fats from fish oil improved more than those given a placebo. 
1. [Hagerman *et al.* (2000)](http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/7/B336.abstract) found that the leg muscles of men aged 60 to 75 were 50% to 80% stronger after they participated in a 16‐week, high‐intensity resistance‐training program twice a week. 
1. [Phennix *et al.* (2000)](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.157.5.715) followed a group of disabled women aged 65 and older for several years.  Those women who had a vitamin B12 deficiency were twice as likely to suffer severe depression as those who did not. 
1. [Muscat *et al.* (2000)]() examined the relationship between cell phone usage and the risk of brain cancer.  They obtained a group of 469 people who had brain cancer and matched each cancer patient with a person of the same age, sex, and race who did not have brain cancer.  They then asked all individuals about their frequency of cell phone use.  Their final conclusion was that "*[o]ur data suggest that the use of hand-held cellular phones is not associated with risk of brain cancer.*"
1. An educational software company wants to compare the effectiveness of its computer animation for teaching biology with that of a textbook presentation.  The company gives a biology pretest to each of a group of high school juniors, and then divides them into two groups.  One group uses the animation, and the other studies the text.  The company retests all students and compares the increase in biology test scores in the two groups.
1. A recent study in Europe looked at a large group of women of childbearing age.  The researchers asked each woman how much alcohol they had consumed over the past 12 months.  The researchers found that women who drank moderate amounts of alcohol were somewhat less likely to have infertility than women who did not.  The study said it "controlled for age, income, and religion." 
1. In 2001 [a report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute](http://bogbit.com/does-working-night-shifts-increase-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/) indicated that women who work at night have a 60% greater risk of developing breast cancer. Researchers based these findings on the work histories of 763 women with breast cancer and 741 women without the disease.
1. [Helle *et al.* (2002)](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/296/5570/1085.full?ijkey=4842612ad61bcf9386845ff5a129be9ae15c158f&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha) reported on a study of women in Finland that indicated that having sons shortened the lifespan of mothers by about 34 weeks per son, but that daughters helped to lengthen the mothers’ lives. The data came from church records from the period 1640 to 1870.
1. Some gardeners prefer to use nonchemical methods to control insect pests in their gardens. Researchers have designed two kinds of traps and want to know which design will be more effective. They randomly choose 10 locations in a large garden and place one of each kind of trap at each location. After a week, they count the number of bugs in each trap.
1. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is currently compiling a registry of patients with Fabry disease, an inherited metabolic disorder. The Fabry disease registry is open to any patient who chooses to participate and is an anonymous list. The registry includes information about the patients' health and allows doctors to follow changes in their symptoms and test results over time. It also allows doctors to compare symptoms between patients who are receiving certain therapies with those who are not receiving therapy.

## Types of Observational Studies I
For each question below, identify (and explain why) whether it represents a voluntary response, convenience, or random sample.

1. A researcher is interested in the makes of cars found in Ashland.  She sits at the corner of Ellis and Hwy 2 and records the makes of cars that are driven by.
1. A researcher is interested in the makes of cars found in Ashland.  She calls a random sample of Ashland phone numbers and asks the respondents if they will take her survey.  If they do, she records the make of car they own.
1. A researcher is interested in the makes of cars found in Ashland.  She collects a sample of car registrations for Ashland owners from a statewide database such that each registration had the same chance of being selected.
1. The manager at Burger King is interested in customer satisfaction.  To get a handle on this he provides each customer with a short survey card to be completed and returned to a collection box on the front counter.
1. A wildlife manager needs to determine the sex ratio of deer in northern Wisconsin.  Towards this end, he records the sex of road-kill deer from along Hwy 2.

## Blood Pressure Study
<img src="zimgs/bloodpressure.jpg" alt="Blood Pressure" class="img-right">
A student is designing an experiment to determine the simultaneous effects of calcium in the diet and regular exercise on blood pressure.  Some subjects will be given a calcium supplement pill and some will be given a placebo pill.  In addition, some subjects will be required to perform aerobic exercises once a day, whereas others will not.  The researcher has 32 male subjects available that are as similar as possible (similar ages, weights, initial blood pressures, etc.).

1. Explain why this is an observational or experimental study.
1. What is an individual?
1. Identify the response variable, factors, levels, treatments, and replicates.
1. Diagram the experimental setup, including placing the unique number of each replicate in the respective treatments.

## Salt, Sand, and Ice
<img src="zimgs/deicer.jpg" alt="De-icer Truck" class="img-right">

A salt and sand mixture is often placed on highways in the winter to aid ice removal. The melting rate of the ice is a function of the percent of salt in the mixture and the ambient air temperature. The melting rate probably levels off after a certain percent of salt and that percent probably differs by temperature. The Department of Transportation (DOT) could save some money if they knew the effect of these two things
on the melting rate.

To test for effects such as these, the DOT has 36 test chambers. In each chamber, there is a small (approx. 1 square meter) section of "highway" and all environmental conditions are controlled, including temperature. The DOT researchers would like to measure the rate of melting at 5F, 15F, and 25F and for mixtures with 10% and 20% salt.

Use this information to answer the questions below.

1. Explain why the described setup is consistent with an experimental study.
1. What are the factors? [*List all of them.*]
1. How many levels are there? [*List in same order as factors in answer b.*]
1. How many treatments are there?
1. What is the response variable?
1. What kind of variable is the response variable?
1. Physically, what is a replicate (not a number)?
1. Diagram the experimental setup, including placing the unique number of each replicate in the respective treatments. [*The table can be similar to the one just above section 3.1.5 in the reading. You can leave space in your document to handwrite the table (rather than typing it). However, show your R work for how you placed these individuals in the R appendix.*]

## Softball Bats and Balls
<img src="zimgs/pitchingmachine.jpg" alt="Pitching Machine" class="img-right">
A student wanted to see how far she could hit two brands of softballs with three types of bats.  The three bats were all 34 inches long, weighed 34 ounces, and looked similar.  Four new balls of each brand were placed into a pitching machine in a random order (the student did not know which brand of ball was being pitched).  The student picked one brand of bat at random to hit each of the eight pitched balls (for simplicity, assume that each ball was hit the first time it was pitched).  The student measured and recorded the distance (in feet) that each ball was hit.  This process was repeated for each bat.

1. Explain why this is an observational or experimental study.
1. What is an individual?
1. Identify the response variable, factors, levels, treatments, and replicates.
1. Describe how you would use randomization in this experiment.  Use R to construct a specific randomization using your randomization strategy.
