<p>Alcohol, drugs, and sex are a part of college life for many students. These aspects of the college experience have been lauded for decades in popular media and are often thought of as the norm for all students. In fact, many students choose to abstain from alcohol, drugs, and sex, which amounts to just as much of a meaningful and “typical” college experience. Regardless of whether or not students engage in alcohol, drugs, and sex, it is imperative that they understand the legal, social, and ethical consequences of their choices and actions. Likewise, students need to be taught the importance of watching out for each other and intervening with peers when they are in danger of drinking too much, being sexually assaulted or sexually assaulting others, and making other problematic decisions. The purpose of this unit is to equip students with some basic skills for making healthy personal choices around alcohol, drugs, and sex, as well as supporting their friends in doing the same.</p>
