<h2>Compost Type and Germination Rates</h2>
<p><img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/zimgs/tagetes.jpg" alt="Tagetes" class="img-right"> The owner of a greenhouse developed a methodology to produce sterilized compost for growing plants that was cheaper than the compost she could buy from her soil supplier and allowed her to reduce waste production. However, these benefits could be offset by losses related to poor plant germination and growth. Thus, the owner attempted to answer the queston about germination success by planting 50 seeds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagetes">marigolds (<em>Tagetes</em> spp.)</a> into individual containers that were filled with either the home-made sterilized compost or compost purchased from the soil supplier. The containers were randomly placed into a large greenhouse where environmental conditions were controlled (i.e., all containers received the same environmental conditions). After five days, the number of (the 50) seeds in each container that had germinated was recorded. The results are shown below.</p>
<pre><code>   compost  n  mean   sd min    Q1 median    Q3 max
1   bought 18 42.67 4.33  36 39.00   42.5 45.50  50
2 homemade 10 28.90 3.21  24 27.25   28.0 31.75  33</code></pre>

<p>Use this information to determine, at the 10% level, if the number of seeds that germinated was lower in the home-made compost. [<em>Note that we are testing to see if the germination rate was lower in the home-made compost because that would suggest that it performs worse than the other compost and would increase costs to the greenhouse.</em>] Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all <a href="../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html">11 steps of a hypothesis test</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
