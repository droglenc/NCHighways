## Fire Blight Disease
<img src="zimgs/fire-blight.jpg" alt="Fire Blight Disease" class="img-right">

Researchers conducted an experiment on 24 trees subject to a fire blight disease.  Each tree was treated with one of several treatments (`A`=no action (control), `B`=removal of the affected branches, `C`=sprayed foliage with an antibiotic and removal of the affected branches).  Each tree was then recorded according to one of three outcomes (`1`=tree died in the same year, `2`=tree died 2-4 years after, `3`=tree died more than 4 years after the disease was noticed). The data below are the treatment and outcomes for each of the 24 trees. Load these data into RStudio and compute results that can be used to answer the questions below.

<pre>
Treat  A A A A A B B B C C A A B B B C C C C B B C C C
Out    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3
</pre>

1. Construct a two-way frequency table of these data (make sure to properly place the response variable in this table).
1. Construct a row-percentage table for these data.
1. Construct a column-percentage table for these data.
1. Construct a total-percentage table for these data.
1. What percentage of the trees in Treatment A died within the first year after the disease was noticed?
1. What percentage of all trees were in Treatment A and died within the first year after the disease was noticed?
1. What percentage of the trees in the control Treatment died more than four years after the disease was noticed?
1. What percentage of the trees that died 2-4 years after the disease was noticed were in the control treatment?
1. What percentage of all trees died within the first year after the disease was noticed?
1. Make an overall conclusion about how the different treatments affected survival of the trees.
