## Sales Transactions

Past sales data for a company indicates that the average sale was $120 per transaction with a standard deviation of $15.  The company provided enhanced training for the new sales force and recorded the amount for 48 transactions.  The results are shown below.

<pre><code>
 n    mean     sd     min     Q1  median     Q3    max
48  130.26   17.6   12.80  67.45  107.10  180.5  317.2 </code></pre>

Did, at the 10% level, the training result in an increase in the mean transaction amount?  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).

## Diet and Weight Gain
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/zimgs/taking-weight.jpg" alt="Cancer Cells" class="img-right">
Suppose that 1500 women followed a popular diet for a month.  A random sample of 35 of these women was taken and the results for weight gained are shown below.

<pre><code>
 n   mean    sd    min    Q1  median     Q3    max
35    6.7   7.3   -2.8   0.7     4.2   10.5   17.2 </code></pre>

Assuming that the standard deviation for all 1500 women was 7.1, test, at the 5% level, that the average weight gain per woman for the month was over 5 pounds.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).
