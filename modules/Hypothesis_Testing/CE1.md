Compute the p-value, include a drawing to support your calculation, and make a decision about H<sub>0</sub> for each situation below.

1. &alpha;=0.10, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;>75, n=50, &sigma;=12, x&#772;=80.5.
1. &alpha;=0.05, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;&#8800;14, n=25, &sigma;=6, x&#772;=10.2.
1. &alpha;=0.01, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;>880, n=80, &sigma;=90, x&#772;=918.
1. &alpha;=0.10, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;<15000, n=50, &sigma;=8000, x&#772;=13700.
