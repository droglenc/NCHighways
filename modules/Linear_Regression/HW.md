## Estimating Fishing Pressure
<img src="../zimgs/boat-launch.jpg" alt="Fishing Pressure" class="img-right">

Wyoming Fish and Game researchers would like to be able to predict monthly fishing pressure (total number of angler-hours) with an index count of the number of vehicles in lake access parking lots because the latter is much cheaper to measure than the former. Towards this end they examined the relationship between pressure and index count on weekdays of Alcova Reservoir. Use the data in AlcovaRes.csv ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/AlcovaRes.csv), [meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/AlcovaRes_meta.txt)), **properly filtered to include only the data from the weekdays**, to construct results that can be used to answer the questions below.

1. What is the response variable?
1. What is the explanatory variable?
1. In terms of the variables of this problem, what is the equation of the best-fit line?
1. In terms of the variables of this problem, interpret the value of the slope.
1. In terms of the variables of this problem, interpret the value of the intercept.
1. What is the predicted pressure for an index count of 20 vehicles?
1. What is the predicted pressure for an index count of 5 vehicles?
1. What is the residual if the pressure is 5100 and the index count is 8 vehicles?
1. What is the correlation coefficient between pressure and index count?
1. What proportion of the variability in pressure is explained by knowing the index count?
1. How much will the pressure estimate be under-predicted, on average, if the number of vehicles is accidentally under-counted by two vehicles?
1. What aspect of this regression analysis concerns you (i.e., consider the regression assumptions)?
