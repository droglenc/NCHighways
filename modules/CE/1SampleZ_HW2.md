## Hawk's Ridge Raptors
<img src="zimgs/hawk_ridge.jpg" alt="Hawk's Ridge" class="img-right">

The Duluth, MN touristry board would like to advertise that, on average, more than 50,000 raptors are seen at Hawk's Ridge per year. Data was recorded for a number of raptor species from 1971-2003 and recorded in HawksRidge.csv ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/HawksRidge.csv), [meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/HawksRidge_meta.txt)). Note that the `Total` variable should be used from this data file as the Board is focused on the total number of raptors seen in a year. Further, assume that it is known that the population standard deviation is 37000 raptors per year. The Board wants there to be strong, if any, evidence to support their claim (i.e., test at the 1% level). Use these data to determine if there is support in these data for the Board's claim.
