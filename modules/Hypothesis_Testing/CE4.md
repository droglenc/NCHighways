## Identifying Type I and II Errors

In each situation below, describe what a Type I and a Type II error is and make an argument for which error is more egregious.  [*Hint: begin by identifying the H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>A</sub> and writing what these hypotheses mean in words.*]

1. The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) limit for salmonella contamination for chicken parts is 15.4% ([source](http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2015/01/fsis-releases-new-salmonella-campylobacter-performance-standards-for-poultry/)).  Suppose that a meat inspector reports that the chicken produced by a particular company exceeds the USDA limit.  A hypothesis test will be performed to determine whether the meat inspectorâ€™s claim appears to be true or not.
1. The process of manufacturing a certain drug is quite complex.  Small departures from the standard procedure can result in a drug that does not meet specifications and is dangerous to the user.  Before being released for use, a sample of a batch of the drug is tested to determine if the mean amount of a particular chemical in the drug exceeds specifications.  A hypothesis test will be performed to determine if the safe level was exceeded.
