As part of their Biology Capstone research, a Northland College student wanted to determine the mean carapace length of Rusty Crayfish (*Orconectes rusticus*) in a lake with Smallmouth Bass (*Micropterus dolomieu*). In 2015, the student gathered (as randomly as possible) and measured the carapace length of 235 Rusty Crayfish from the lake with Smallmouth Bass.

## Transfer of Invasive Species
<img src="../zimgs/ballast-water.jpg" alt="Ballast Water Discharge" class="img-right">

Many invasive aquatic organisms have been transferred to the Great Lakes in the ballast water of trans-oceanic ships. In an effort to minimize the number of new invading species, ships are now required to release their ballast water before entering the St. Lawrence Seaway. Ships laden with cargo generally do not contain ballast. However, their ballast tanks often contain some residual amount of water and, thus, may harbor invasive organisms. Researchers with Michigan Sea Grant ([more information on page 9 here](http://www.miseagrant.umich.edu/downloads/upwellings/sum02.pdf)) examined the water found in 43 ballast tanks from 22 cargo-laden boats entering the Seaway in 2001. They were interested in determining the proportion of ballast tanks that contained living organisms.
