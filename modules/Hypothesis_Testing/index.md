A researcher may form an *a priori* hypothesis about a parameter and then use information from a sample to judge the "correctness" of the hypothesis.  This judgment is complicated by sampling variability.  Thus, an elaborate procedure is used to make sure that the final conclusion acknowledges the imperfect representation of the parameter by the statistic.  This procedure is called hypothesis testing and is the focus of this module.

## Preparation for Class

* Your initial preparation for this module should begin by reading **Section 10.1** in [the textbook](../../book/) and watching this video on [Forming Statistical Hypotheses](https://vimeo.com/user45324800/hotest-hypotheses){:target="_blank"} [6 mins; [![PowerPoint](../../img/ppt.png)](PPT-hypotheses.pptx)].  We will begin class with the first class exercise below.
* A first lecture ([these slides](PPT-Lecture-1.pptx)) will be used to introduce the concept of hypothesis testing.  This lecture will be followed by work on the second set of class exercises below.
* Following this you should re-read **Section 10.1** in [the textbook](../../book/), and watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/v/7mE-K_w1v90?version=3&autoplay=1){:target="_blank"} [8 mins] and [this](https://www.youtube.com/v/OWn3Ko1WYTA?version=3&start=89&end=247&autoplay=1){:target="_blank"} [3 mins] video on statistical error types and [this](https://www.youtube.com/v/BJZpx7Mdde4?version=3&autoplay=1){:target="_blank"} [12 mins] video on computing &beta; &amp; power.
* A second lecture ([these slides](PPT-Lecture-2.pptx)) will be used to reinforce these materials before working on the last set of class exercises below.
* Finally, you should read **Section 10.5** in [the textbook](../../book/) and watch this video on the [11 Steps for Any Hypothesis Test](https://vimeo.com/user45324800/hotest-11steps){:target="_blank"} [5 mins; [![PowerPoint](../../img/ppt.png)](../1-Sample-Z/PPT1.pptx)].
