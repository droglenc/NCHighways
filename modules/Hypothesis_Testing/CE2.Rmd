## Identifying Type I and II Errors

In each situation below, describe what a Type I and a Type II error is and make an argument for which error is more egregious.  [*Hint: begin by identifying the H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>A</sub>.*]

1. The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) limit for salmonella contamination for chicken is 20%.  A meat inspector reports that the chicken produced by a company exceeds the USDA limit.  You perform a hypothesis test to determine whether the meat inspectorâ€™s claim is true.
1. The process of manufacturing a certain drug is quite complex.  Small departures from the standard procedure can result in a drug that does not meet specifications and is dangerous to the user.  Before being released for use a sample of a batch of the drug is tested to determine if a particular chemical in the drug exceeds specifications.

## Understanding Power Relationships
<img src="../zimgs/computer-1.jpg" alt="Simulations" class="img-right">
The probability of a type II error (&beta;) and power cannot be computed because the true population mean (&mu;<sub>a</sub>) is not known.  However, &beta; and power are affected by &alpha;, n, &sigma;, and "how wrong" the null hypothesized value is.  Simulations with known populations can be used to understand the relationships between &beta;, power, and these other values.  Because &alpha; and n are chosen by the statistician, decisions can be made that will affect the values of &beta; and power (though we will never know the actual values of &beta; and power).

The `powerSim()` function (with no arguments) from `NCStats` provides an efficient method to perform these simulations.  For example, `powerSim()` produced the plots shown below.  The top plot is the "null distribution" or the sampling distribution of the sample means assuming that H<sub>0</sub>: &mu;=100 is true (and &sigma;=10 and n=30).  The rejection region that is defined by &alpha;=0.05 and assuming that H</sub>A</sub>: &mu;<100  (i.e., lower-tailed) is shown on the null distribution as the red shaded area bound by the vertical red line.  Thus, any sample mean in this shaded area would result in a decision to reject H<sub>0</sub>.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=5,fig.height=6}
powerSim()
```

The lower plot is the "actual distribtion" or the sampling distribution that would result if &mu;=95 (in this example) and &sigma;=10 and n=30.  The rejection region is projected onto this plot with the red vertical line.  Because &mu;=95 is different than &mu;<sub>0</sub>=100, these graphs represent the situation where the H<sub>0</sub> is incorrect.  Rejecting H<sub>0</sub> in this situation is a correct decision and the probability of making that decision is power.  Power is shown on the actual distribution with the green shaded area and is equal to the value shown in the upper corner (left corner in this case).  A type II error occurs if the H<sub>0</sub> is not rejected.  The probability of making this errors is shown by the   The area in this distribution that is in the rejection region
