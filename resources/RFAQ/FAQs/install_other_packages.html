<h1>When I load the NCStats package R says that it cannot find some other packages.</h1>
<p>The NCStats package is a package of routines that I have written to make some aspects of using R for statistics classes at Northland easier.  This package requires these packages to work properly ...</p>

<ul>
	<li> car
	<li> gdata
	<li> gplots
	<li> Hmisc
	<li> nortest
	<li> plotrix
	<li> sciplot
	<li> TeachingDemos
</ul>

<p>If these packages are not properly installed then <font face="Courier New" color="#FF0000">library(NCStats)</font> will produce an error where R says it cannot find one of these packages.</p>

<p>Installing these other packages requires an internet connection.  If you are using a Windows machine you can follow these steps to install these other packages.</p>

<ol>
	<li> Open R
	<li> Select the "Packages" menu and the "Install Packages" submenu.
	<li> Select a mirror site in the U.S. from the ensuing dialog box.
	<li> Select the packages listed above in the ensuing dialog box.  Multiple packages can be selected at once by holding down the CTRL key while selecting from the list.
	<li> Press the OK button.
</ol>

<p>If you are using a Macintosh you will need to install these packages through the Package Manager.</p>

<p>R will then take several minutes to download the required packages and install them.</p>
