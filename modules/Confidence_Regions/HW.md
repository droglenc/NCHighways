## Confidence Regions Calculations

For each situation below, (a) identify the level of confidence; (b) whether a lower confidence bound, upper confidence bound, or confidence interval should be constructed; (c) find Z<sup>*</sup> (include a drawing that illustrates your calculation); (d) construct the confidence region; and (e) specifically interpret the confidence region.

1. &alpha;=0.05, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;<80, n=30, &sigma;=20, x&#772;=73.
1. &alpha;=0.05, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;&#8800;1500, n=40, &sigma;=800, x&#772;=1370.

## Beetle Size
<img src="../zimgs/beetle.jpg" alt="Beetle" class="img-right">
Researchers examined the size of two different species of beetles. They hypothesized that the thorax length of the *Halticus oleracea* species would be greater than 190 mm. The data for their study is in Beetles.csv ([file](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/Beetles.csv), [meta](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/blob/master/Beetles_meta.txt)).  Use this information to (i) construct an appropriate confidence region assuming &sigma;=14 and &alpha;=0.05, and (ii) summarize your findings in terms of the beetle's thorax size.
