## Identifying Hypotheses

For each research hypothesis or statement below, construct the null and alternative hypotheses (use their respective symbols) and explicitly define the parameter in the hypotheses.

1. The mean number of murders per burrough in New York City in 2010 was less than 90.
1. The Toyota dealership has advertised that oil changes will be completed in 15 minutes or less. Test whether their advertisement is incorrect, on average.
1. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases reports that the average cost of bariatric (weight loss) surgery is $22,500. You think that this information is incorrect. 
1. Washburn High School publicizes that 61% of its students are involved in at least one extracurricular activity. A parent organization believes that the percentage is higher.

## P-Value Calculations and Decisions I

For each situation below, (i) write a sentence that defines the p-value specific to that situation (i.e., replace the generic terms in the definition of the p-value with specifics for the particular situation), (ii) compute the p-value (include a drawing to support your calculation), and (iii) make a decision about H<sub>0</sub> (i.e., reject or do not reject H<sub>0</sub> and explain why).

1. H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;&#8800;14, &sigma;=6, n=25, x&#772;=11.2, &alpha;=0.05.
1. H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;>75, &sigma;=12, n=50, x&#772;=79.5, &alpha;=0.10.
1. H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;<15000, &sigma;=8000, n=50, x&#772;=13700, &alpha;=0.10.
