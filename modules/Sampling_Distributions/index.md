Sampling distributions show the distribution of a statistic from many all possible samples.  Sampling distributions are the cornerstone of inferential statistics.  Thus, understanding sampling distributions is key as we transition to performing inferential statistics.  Sampling distributions are the subject of this module.

<p>After completing this module, you should be able to ...</p>

<ol>
  <li>Describe the concept of sampling variability.</li>
  <li>Describe why sampling variability must be dealt with to make inferences.</li>
  <li>Describe what a sampling distribution represents.</li>
  <li>Identify how a sampling distribution differs from a population distribution.</li>
  <li>Describe what a standard error is.</li>
  <li>Identify how a standard error differs from a standard deviation.</li>
  <li>Describe how and why sampling distributions are simulated.</li>
  <li>Explain the concepts of precision, accuracy, and bias as it relates to statistics and parameters.</li>
  <li>Describe the theoretical distribution of the sampling distribution of the sample means.</li>
  <li>Gain some belief that the theoretical distribution actually represents the sampling distribution of the sample means.</li>
  <li>Use the sampling distribution of sample means to compute the probability of particular sets of means.</li>

You should prepare for the concepts of this module by reading **Chapter 9** in [the textbook](../../book/) and watching the following videos:

* [Introduction to Sampling Distributions](https://www.youtube.com/v/Zbw-YvELsaM?version=3&autoplay=1){:target="_blank"} [8 mins]

Questions 9.22-9.24 in [the textbook](../../book/) will assess your understanding of these materials.
