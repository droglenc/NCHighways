<p>Feeling connected to the local community and local landscapes is critical to a successful college experience. Students who develop a strong “sense of place” (connection and belonging to where they are) are more likely to remain at the institution and persist to graduation. Northern Wisconsin is a rich tapestry woven together by human and ecological influences, past and present. Helping cultivate students’ awareness and knowledge of, and connection to that tapestry is an important part of Northland Highways and the first semester experience. In partnership with the SOEI, students will go on an outing to a local area to have an experience in nature that helps them connect with the local landscape, understand the history of the area, and interact with peers in new ways. These experiences will be coupled with a reflective writing assignment, which will help students to process what they experience in the field.</p>

<p>After completing this module, you should be able to ...</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define “sense of place”.</li>
  <li>Identify and describe one or more ways they feel connected to Ashland and the surrounding natural environment.</li>
  <li>Describe the importance of connecting to place in the context of the broader college experience.</li>
