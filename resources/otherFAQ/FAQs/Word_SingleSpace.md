**Homework assignments should be single-spaced** ([see expectations for homework here](../../hwformat)), but MSWord does not default to single-spacing.  To single-space a document, select all text in your document (or a single paragraph), right-click on the text you selected, and select the *Paragraph* item.  About half-way down in the ensuing dialog box is a section labeled *Spacing*.  In that section, change the item in the drop-down box under *Line spacing* to *Single*.  Press *OK*.

Also see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBWm3oJ3b4k) for how to make this setting permanent.
