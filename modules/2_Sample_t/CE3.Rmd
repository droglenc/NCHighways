## Delivering Military Supplies
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/zimgs/navy-shipping.jpg" alt="Navy Shipping" class="img-right">
Following the [Persian Gulf War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War), the Pentagon changed its logistics processes to be more "corporate-like" -- the "just-in-case" mentality was replaced with "just-in-time" systems.  Emulating Federal Express and United Parcel Service, deliveries from factories to foxholes were expedited using bar codes, laser cards, radio tags, and databases to track supplies.  The data below contains order-to-delivery times (in days) for shipments from the United States to the Persian Gulf in 1991 (old system) and shipments to Bosnia in 1995 (new system).  Use these data to determine, at the 5% level, if the mean delivery rates declined significantly under the new system.  Assume that the distribution are approxiately normally distributed.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).[^1]
