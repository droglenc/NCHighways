Many of the class modules have links to YouTube or Vimeo videos as part of the class preparation materials. Some students have reported issues with watching these videos. Below are some hints that have helped with these issues. Please [let me know](mailto:derek@derekogle.com) if these solutions don't work for you or if you have found other solutions.

## Vimeo Videos
The Vimeo videos are produced by me and will require you to use the password of "**NCStats**" (note capitalization and don't use the quotes) to view. These vidoes may also have PowerPoint or other icons following the link to the video. These link to materials used in the video that you may find useful to see or print (for taking notes on) as you watch the video.

Here is a sample:

* Video: [Randomization in R](https://vimeo.com/user45324800/random-numbers){:target="_blank"} [3 mins] [![Web](../../../img/web.png)](../../../modules/DataProduction_RHO.html){:target="_blank"}  [![PDF](../../../img/pdf.png)](../../../modules/DataProduction_RHO.pdf) [![MSWord](../../../img/word.png)](../../../modules/DataProduction_RHO.docx)  [![R](../../../img/Rlogo.png)](../../../modules/DataProduction_RHO.R){:target="_blank"}


## YouTube Videos (IE and Firefox)
It appears that the videos open without issue in Internet Explorer. With Firefox, the videos may appear to not exist, but will appear if you put the cursor in the web address bar and press Enter.

Here is a sample:

* Video: [Types of Conclusions](https://www.youtube.com/v/5zkg1w5zoQ0?rel=0&start=1597){:target="_blank"} [3 mins]


## YouTube Videos (Chrome)
In Chrome, the videos will NOT play the way that I have linked to them. If you insist on using Chrome, you can replace the "v/" portion of the URL in the address bar to "watch?v=". I would also change the "?" in front of "rel=0" to an "&". Thus, an address like "https://www.youtube.com/v/yxXsPc0bphQ?rel=0" would be changed to "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxXsPc0bphQ&rel=0".
