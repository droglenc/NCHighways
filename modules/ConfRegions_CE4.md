Suppose that you are starting a business and it is important for your business plan to have an estimate of the mean weekly Internet usage of households in your city.  Assume that you know from previous surveys that the standard deviation of weekly Internet usage is 6.95 minutes.[^1]

1. How many households must you randomly select to be 95% sure that the sample mean is within 1 minute of the population mean.
1. How many households must you randomly select to be 90% sure that the sample mean is within 1 minute of the population mean.

## Blood Pressure in Children
<img src="zimgs/bloodpressure2.jpg" alt="Blood Pressure" class="img-right">

An investigator wants to estimate the mean systolic blood pressure in children with congenital heart disease who are between the ages of 3 and 5.  The investigator plans on using a 99% confidence interval and desires a margin of error of 5 units.  The standard deviation of systolic blood pressure is unknown, but the investigator conducted a literature review and found that the standard deviation of systolic blood pressures in children with other cardiac defects is between 15 and 20.[^2]

1. Use this information to construct a "worst-case scenario" required sample size.
1. How would the required sample size change for the "best-case scenario".
