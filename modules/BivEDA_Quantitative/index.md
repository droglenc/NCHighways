<div class="ILOs">
<p>It is important to understand the relationship between two variables.  With quantitative data, this primarily consists of using a scatterplot and the correlation coefficient to describe four key characteristics of the relationship.  This module describes how to construct a scatterplot, calculate a correlation coefficient, and how to use these results to prepare a synthetic description of the relationship between two quantitative variables.</p>

<p>After completing this module, you should be able to ...</p>

<ol>
  <li>Construct a scatterplot with R.</li>
  <li>Know when it is appropriate to calculation a correlation coefficient.</li>
  <li>Calculate a correlation coefficient with R.</li>
  <li>Construct a succinct written summary that addresses the four key characteristics (form, direction, outliers, and strength) of the relationship between two quantitative variables.</li>
</ol>
