## Study Types I
For each question below, identify (and explain why) whether it represents an observational or experimental study.

1. [Stoll et al. (1999)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10232294) followed 30 people with bipolar disorder over a 4‐month period.  Patients who were given a high dose (10 g/day) of omega‐3 fats from fish oil improved more than those given a placebo. 
1. [Hagerman et al. (2000)](http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/7/B336.abstract) found that the leg muscles of men aged 60 to 75 were 50% to 80% stronger after they participated in a 16‐week, high‐intensity resistance‐training program twice a week. 
1. [Phennix et al. (2000)](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.157.5.715) followed a group of disabled women aged 65 and older for several years.  Those women who had a vitamin B12 deficiency were twice as likely to suffer severe depression as those who did not. 
1. [Muscat et al. (2000)]() examined the relationship between cell phone usage and the risk of brain cancer.  They obtained a group of 469 people who had brain cancer and matched each cancer patient with a person of the same age, sex, and race who did not have brain cancer.  They then asked all individuals about their frequency of cell phone use.  Their final conclusion was that "*[o]ur data suggest that the use of hand-held cellular phones is not associated with risk of brain cancer.*”
1. An educational software company wants to compare the effectiveness of its computer animation for teaching biology with that of a textbook presentation.  The company gives a biology pretest to each of a group of high school juniors, and then divides them into two groups.  One group uses the animation, and the other studies the test.  The company retests all students and compares the increase in biology test scores in the two groups.
1. A recent study in Europe looked at a large group of women of childbearing age.  The 
researchers asked each woman how much alcohol they had consumed over the past 12 months.  The researchers found that women who drank moderate amounts of alcohol were somewhat less likely to have infertility than women who did not.  The study said it “controlled for age, income, and religion”.

## Study Types II
For each question below, identify (and explain why) whether it represents an observational or experimental study.

1. In 2001 [a report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute](http://bogbit.com/does-working-night-shifts-increase-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/) indicated that women who work at night have a 60% greater risk of developing breast cancer. Researchers based these findings on the work histories of 763 women with breast cancer and 741 women without the disease.
1. [Helle et al. (2002)](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/296/5570/1085.full?ijkey=4842612ad61bcf9386845ff5a129be9ae15c158f&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha) reported on a study of women in Finland that indicated that having sons shortened the lifespan of mothers by about 34 weeks per son, but that daughters helped to lengthen the mothers’ lives. The data came from church records from the period 1640 to 1870.
1. Some gardeners prefer to use nonchemical methods to control insect pests in their gardens. Researchers have designed two kinds of traps, and want to know which design will be more effective. They randomly choose 10 locations in a large garden and place one of each kind of trap at each location. After a week, they count the number of bugs in each trap.

## Types of Observational Studies
For each question below, identify (and explain why) whether it represents a voluntary response, convenience, or random sample.

1. A researcher is interested in the makes of cars found in Ashland.  She sits at the corner of Ellis and Hwy 2 and records the makes of cars that are driven by.
1. A researcher is interested in the makes of cars found in Ashland.  She calls a random sample of Ashland phone numbers and asks the respondents if they will take her survey.  If they do, she records the make of car they own.
1. A researcher is interested in the makes of cars found in Ashland.  She collects a sample of car registrations for Ashland owners from a statewide database such that each registration had the same chance of being selected.
1. The manager at Burger King is interested in customer satisfaction.  To get a handle on this he provides each customer with a short survey card to be completed and returned to a collection box on the front counter.
1. A wildlife manager needs to determine the sex ratio of deer in northern Wisconsin.  Towards this end, he records the sex of road-kill deer from along Hwy 2.

## Blood Pressure Study
<img src="../zimgs/bloodpressure.jpg" alt="Blood Pressure" class="img-right">
A student is designing an experiment to determine the simultaneous effects of calcium in the diet and regular exercise on blood pressure.  Some subjects will be given a calcium supplement pill and some will be given a placebo pill.  In addition, some subjects will be required to perform aerobic exercises once a day, whereas others will not.  The researcher has 32 male subjects available that are as similar as possible (similar ages, weights, initial blood pressures, etc.).

1. Explain why this is an observational or experimental study.
1. What is an individual?
1. Identify the response variable, factors, levels, treatments, and replicates.
1. Using R, identify which specific individuals will be allocated to each treatment.

## Softball Bats and Balls
<img src="../zimgs/pitchingmachine.jpg" alt="Pitching Machine" class="img-right">
A student wanted to see how far she could hit two brands of softballs with three types of bats.  The three bats were all 34 inches long and weighed 34 ounces.  Four new balls of each brand were placed into a pitching machine in a random order (the student did not now which type of ball was coming).  The distance (in feet) that each ball was hit (if the ball was not hit or was hit very poorly, then it was put back into the pitching machine).

1. Explain why this is an observational or experimental study.
1. What is an individual?
1. Identify the response variable, factors, levels, treatments, and replicates.
1. Using R, identify which specific individuals will be allocated to each treatment.  Comment on what this physically means in terms of implementing this experiment.

## Identify Response and Explanatory Variables

Identify the (i) response and (ii) explanatory variable in each of the following situations.

1. The distance of a putt and the golfer's success rate at making the putt.
1. Response time to a particular dexterity test and the amount of time awake.
1. Amount of fertilizer and growth of tomatoe plants.
1. Sales of shoes and sales of hats.
1. Amount of rainfall and sales of umbrellas (in New York City).
1. The age and weight of a child (measured over time).
