<img src="zimgs/pollen.jpg" alt="Pollen" class="img-right">
Suppose that it is known that the distribution of the total weed pollen count (spores per cubic meter of air) for LaCrosse, WI on a day in early September is approximately normal with a mean of 40 and a standard deviation of 8.  [*FYI, pollen count information is available from [this site](http://www.aaaai.org/nab/index.cfm?p=allergenreport&stationid=28).*]

From this, answer the following questions.

1. What is an individual?
1. What is the variable?
1. What type of variable is that?
1. What is &mu;?
1. What is &sigma;?

Additionally, for each questions below (a) identify the type of question (e.g., "forward-left", "reverse-between") and then (b) answer the question.

1. What is the number of pores/m<sup>3</sup> such that 10% of the days have higher pore counts?
1. What proportion of days in LaCrosse have a weed pollen count less than 50 pores/m<sup>3</sup>?
1. What proportion of days in LaCrosse have a weed pollen count between 32 and 55 pores/m<sup>3</sup>?
1. What is the number of pores/m<sup>3</sup> such that 30% of the days have lower pore counts?
1. What is the most common 70% of number of pores/m<sup>3</sup>?
1. What proportion of days in LaCrosse have a weed pollen count greater than 35 pores/m<sup>3</sup>?
