<li>
1-sample t-test because (i) one population (all nation-states) was sampled, (ii) a quantitative variable (number of killings) was recorded, and (iii) <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is not known.
</li>
<li>
An observational study with clear randomization of 75 countries.
</li>
<li>
The assumptions are met because (i) <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is not known and (ii) n=75&gt;40.

<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>=3292.8 killings.

t=-1.4592 with 74 df.

</li>
<li>
Do not reject <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}\)</span> because the p-value&gt;<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
It appears that the number of killings for recent times is NOT significanlty lower than it was as determined from 19th century history books.
</li>
<li>
Strinctly not needed, but one could say that they were 95% confident that the number of killings in recent years for ALL nation-states is less than 4219 (which contains the value in the <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}\)</span>).

</li>
<li>
A one-sample t-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (thickness) was measured, (ii)the individuals are from one population (the ozone layer), and (iii) <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is not known. Thus, the population mean is being compared to a specific value in the null hypothesis.
</li>
<li>
An observational study of 45 random samples of the ozone was conducted.
</li>
<li>
The assumptions are met because <span class="math inline">\(n=45&gt;40\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is UNknown.

The mean thickness of the ozone layer at ALL locations appears to be different (specifically greater) than 300 Dobson units.

I am 99% confident that the mean thickness of the ozone layer in ALL locations between 337 and 354 Dobson Units (Table 1).
