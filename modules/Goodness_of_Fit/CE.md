## Preference for Bottled Water?
<img src="../zimgs/bottled-water-waste.jpg" alt="Scales of Justice" class="img-right">
Students in an Introduction to Environmental Studies course conducted a study to determine preferences (or not) for bottled water.  In one part of their study, a sample of students were given four samples of water in clear unmarked cups.  The water was either from the local water source (tap water) or bottled water from Aquafina, Fiji, or Sam's Choice.  Each subject tried each sample of water, without knowing which type they were trying, and then recorded the type that they "most preferred."  They found that 51, 18, 17, and 21 subjects most preferred the tap water, Aquafina, Fiji, and Sam's Choice options, respectively.  Use these results to determine if there is any differences in the most preferred choices of water.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).[^1]

## Habitat Use by Wild Turkeys
<img src="../zimgs/merriam-turkey.jpg" alt="Merriam's Turkey" class="img-right">
[Rumble and Anderson (1992)](http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_1992_rumble_m002.pdf) examined habitat use by [Merriam's Wild Turkey (*Meleagris gallopavo merriami*)](http://wildturkeyzone.com/wildturkey/merriams.htm) in South Dakota.  In one part of their study they identified the major vegetative type (called Habitat below) in 4-32 hectare sampling units.  They then computed the proportions of total area available to turkeys by major vegetation type (first row below).  Turkeys' were trapped and fit with radio transmitters.  Each bird was then located three times per week with the location of the bird being recorded.  The frequency of locations by each major vegatation type was computed for each of four seasons.  The area available and the seasonal frequency of turkey locations in each habitat are shown below.

<pre>
Habitat             Aspen    Meadow     Pine       Oak     Spruce
Area Avaialable    0.0516    0.1016    0.8371    0.0044    0.0056
Winter Use             4        11       186         4         0         
Spring Use            61         9       807         0         1
Summer Use            17         5       100         1         3
Fall Use              14         7       195         1         1
</pre>

Use these results to determine if the turkey's exhibited a habitat preference in the **Spring**.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).

## Random Jury Pool?
<img src="../zimgs/jury-box.jpg" alt="Jury Box" class="img-right">
A defense attorney claimed that a jury pool is not representative of the larger population in the court's district.  In particular, she was concerned that the jury pool contained fewer "young people" than would be expected based on district demographics.  To test her claim, she created seven age categories, counted the number of individuals from the jury pool in each age category, and found the percentage of the district in each age category from the most recent census data.  Her findings are below.[^2]

<pre>
Ages         18-19    20-24    25-29    30-39    40-49    50-64      65+
Jury Pool       23       96      134      293      297      380      113
District      6.1%    15.0%    13.5%    21.7%    15.3%    18.2%    10.2%
</pre>

Use these results to determine if the age distribution in the jury pool accurately represents the age distriction of the district as a whole.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).  Also comment on whether the attorney's specific concern was warranted.
