title: Bivariate EDA - Quantitative
---

It is important to understand the relationship between two variables.  With quantitative data, this primarily consists of using a scatterplot and the correlation coefficient to describe four key characteristics of the relationship.  This module describes how to construct a scatterplot, calculate a correlation coefficient, and how to use these results to prepare a synthetic description of the relationship between two quantitative variables.

## Intended Learning Outcomes
After completing this module, the student should be able to ...

1. Construct a scatterplot with R.
1. Know when it is appropriate to calculation a correlation coefficient.
1. Calculate a correlation coefficient with R.
1. Construct a succinct written summary that addresses the four key characteristics (form, direction, outliers, and strength) of the relationship between two quantitative variables.
