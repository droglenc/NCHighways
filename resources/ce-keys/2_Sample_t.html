<li>
<span class="math inline">\(H_{A}: \mu_{b}-\mu_{h}&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}: \mu_{b}-\mu_{h}=0\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the mean number of germinated plants, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the bought compost, and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is the homemade compost.
</li>
<li>
2-sample t-test because (i) two populations/groups are considered (bought and homemade compost), (ii) a quantitative variable (number germinated) was recorded, and (iii) the sanples are independent (there is no known connection between all pairs of bought and homemade individuals.
</li>
<li>
An experimental study with some randomization (placement of containers in the greenhouse).
</li>
<li>
The assumptions are met because (i) the samples are independent (as described above) and (ii) <span class="math inline">\(n_{b}+n_{h}\)</span>=18+10=28&gt;15 and the two sampling distributions are not obviously strongly skewed.
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}\)</span>=42.67-28.9=13.77.
</li>
<li>
t=8.7763 with 26 df.
</li>
<li>
p-value<span class="math inline">\(&lt;0.00005\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
Reject <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}\)</span> because the p-value&lt;<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
It appears that the the number of plants that germinate is significantly lower for the homemage than the bought compost.
</li>
<li>
I am 90% confident that the number of plants that germinated with the bought compost is more than 11.7 greater than the number of plants that germinated with the homemade compost.

<h2>Thickness of the Ozone Layer</h2>

<li>
<span class="math inline">\(H_{O}:\mu=300\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_{A}:\mu\neq300\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the mean thickness of the ozone layer from ALL locations.
</li>
<li>
A one-sample t-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (thickness) was measured, (ii)the individuals are from one population (the ozone layer over Arosa, SWI), and (iii) <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is not known. Thus, the population mean is being compared to a specific value in the null hypothesis.
</li>
<li>
An observational study of 45 random samples of ozone was conducted.
</li>
<li>
The assumptions are met because <span class="math inline">\(n=45&gt;40\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is UNknown.

The test statistic is Z=13.923 with 44 df (Table 1).

The p-value <span class="math inline">\(&lt;0.00005\)</span> (Table 1).

The <span class="math inline">\(H_{O}\)</span> is rejected because the <span class="math inline">\(p-value&lt;\alpha\)</span> (Table 1).
</li>
<li>
The mean thickness of the ozone layer at ALL areas abova Arosa, SWI appears to be different (specifically greater) than 300 Dobson units.
</li>
<li>
I am 99% confident that the mean thickness of the ozone layer in ALL areas above Arosa, SWI is between 337 and 354 Dobson Units (Table 1).
