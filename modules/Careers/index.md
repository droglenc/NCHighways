<p>For most students, college is viewed as a necessary step toward getting a stable job and launching a successful career in their chosen fields of work. Understandably, making decisions that will potentially impact their long-term career path can seem daunting and even insurmountable. In reality, nearly Â¾ of college students change their major at least once during their undergraduate education. As students progress through their first few semesters, they get a more realistic sense of what types of classes resonate with them and the potential jobs that a given major might help them acquire in the future. Therefore, it is essential that students are exposed to the multitude of academic and professional opportunities available to them. And in the context of a liberal arts education, it is important that students understand the interdisciplinary and integrated nature of their academic and career pathways. Furthermore, students need to understand how to appropriately sequence their courses over the coming semesters in order to graduate in a timely manner. The purpose of this unit is to expose students to the wide range of academic options available to them at NC, and to help them understand the ways in which their academic experiences may be applicable to future professional endeavors.</p>
