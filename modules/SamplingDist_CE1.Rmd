## Constructing a Sampling Distribution
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/zimgs/calculator-1.jpg" alt="Calculations" class="img-right">
Use the very simple population of five individuals with the following values -- 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 -- to answer the following questions.

1. Compute the center and dispersion (to three decimals) of this population.  Label your results with appropriate symbols.
1. Identify all possible samples of n=2 from this population.  [*Note that there are 10 such samples.*]
1. Compute the mean for each sample.
1. Compute the mean of all 10 sample means.  [*See the hint further below*]
1. Compute the standard deviation of all 10 sample means.  What should this result be called?
1. Repeat the previous four questions for samples of n=3.  [*Note that there is again 10 samples.*]
1. Repeat the previous question for samples of n=4.  [*Note that there are 5 such samples*]
1. How did each of the three means of the sample means compare to the population mean?
1. How did the means of the sample means change with increasing n?
1. How did each of the three standard deviations of the sample means compare to the population standard deviation?
1. How did the standard deviations of the sample means change with increasing n?

<p class="bg-info"><strong>Hint:</strong> the mean and standard deviation of the sample means can be efficiently computed by entering the means into a vector in R and then submitting that vector to <code>Summarize()</code> from <code>NCStats</code>.</p>

```{r}
mns <- c(5.6,6.7,7.8,8.9)  # dummy data as an example
Summarize(mns,digits=3)
```
