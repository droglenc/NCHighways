## Study Types I
For each question below, identify (and explain why) whether it represents an observational or experimental study.

1. [Stoll *et al.* (1999)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10232294) followed 30 people with bipolar disorder over a 4‐month period.  Patients who were given a high dose (10 g/day) of omega‐3 fats from fish oil improved more than those given a placebo. 
1. [Hagerman *et al.* (2000)](http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/7/B336.abstract) found that the leg muscles of men aged 60 to 75 were 50% to 80% stronger after they participated in a 16‐week, high‐intensity resistance‐training program twice a week. 
1. [Phennix *et al.* (2000)](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.157.5.715) followed a group of disabled women aged 65 and older for several years.  Those women who had a vitamin B12 deficiency were twice as likely to suffer severe depression as those who did not. 
1. [Muscat *et al.* (2000)]() examined the relationship between cell phone usage and the risk of brain cancer.  They obtained a group of 469 people who had brain cancer and matched each cancer patient with a person of the same age, sex, and race who did not have brain cancer.  They then asked all individuals about their frequency of cell phone use.  Their final conclusion was that "*[o]ur data suggest that the use of hand-held cellular phones is not associated with risk of brain cancer.*"
1. An educational software company wants to compare the effectiveness of its computer animation for teaching biology with that of a textbook presentation.  The company gives a biology pretest to each of a group of high school juniors, and then divides them into two groups.  One group uses the animation, and the other studies the text.  The company retests all students and compares the increase in biology test scores in the two groups.
1. A recent study in Europe looked at a large group of women of childbearing age.  The researchers asked each woman how much alcohol they had consumed over the past 12 months.  The researchers found that women who drank moderate amounts of alcohol were somewhat less likely to have infertility than women who did not.  The study said it "controlled for age, income, and religion.""
