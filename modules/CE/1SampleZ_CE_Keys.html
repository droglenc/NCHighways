An observational study as the women chose to be on the diet. There is clear randomization in this study.

<li>
H<sub>O</sub>: μ=50000, H<sub>A</sub>: μ&gt;50000, where μ is the mean number of raptors seen in ALL years at Hawk’s Ridge.
</li>
<li>
A one-sample Z-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (number of raptors) was measured, (ii)the individuals are from one group or population (all years at Hawk’s Ridge), and (iii) σ is known (=37000). Thus, the population mean is being compared to a specific value in the null hypothesis.
</li>
<li>
An observational sample of years that was not random was taken.

The assumptions are met because n=32&gt;30 and σ is known.

H<sub>O</sub>: μ=8, H<sub>A</sub>: μ&gt;8, where μ is the mean Elk density in Banff.
<li>
A 1-sample Z-test is required because a quantitative variable (Elk density) was measured on individuals from one group or population (plots in Banff National Park) and σ is known (given in background).
<li>
An observational sample that is not obiously random was selected.
<li>
The assumptions are met because n=15 and population is approximately normal (given in background) and σ is known.

<h2>Credit Card Limits</h2>

<li>
α=0.10.
<li>
H<sub>A</sub>: μ&gt;630 and H<sub>O</sub>: μ=630, where μ is the mean credit card limit for all companies.
<li>
A one-sample Z-test is required because a quantitative variable (credit score) was measured on individuals from one group or population (all credit card companies) and σ is known (given in background).
<li>
An observational sample, with no evidence of randomness, was selected.
<li>
The assumptions are met because n<span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span> 30 and σ is known.

The statistic is x̄=636.86.

The test statistic is Z=<span class="math inline">\(\frac{636.86-630}{\frac{5}{\sqrt{44}}}\)</span>=9.11
<li>
The p-value is <span class="math inline">\(&lt;0.00005\)</span>.
<li>
The H<sub>O</sub> is rejected because the p-value&lt;α.
<li>
It appears that the credit threshold is greater than 60. Thus, it appears that the credit card companies have increased the threshold for issuing a credit card.
<li>
A 90% lower confidence bound with Z<sup>*</sup>=`r formatC(distrib(0.90,type=“q”,lower.tail=FALSE,plot=FALSE),format=“f”,digits=3)}. Thus, 636.86-1.282<span class="math inline">\(\frac{5}{\sqrt{44}}\)</span> or 636.86-0.97 = 635.89.
