## Salt, Sand, and Ice
<img src="../zimgs/deicer.jpg" alt="De-icer Truck" class="img-right">

A salt and sand mixture is often placed on highways in the winter to aid ice removal. The melting rate of the ice is a function of the percent of salt in the mixture and the ambient air temperature. The melting rate probably levels off after a certain percent of salt and that percent probably differs by temperature. The Department of Transportation (DOT) could save some money if they knew the effect of these two things
on the melting rate.

To test for effects such as these, the DOT has 36 test chambers. In each chamber, there is a small (approx. 1 square meter) section of "highway" and all environmental conditions are controlled, including temperature. The DOT researchers would like to measure the rate of melting at 5F, 15F, and 25F and for mixtures with 10% and 20% salt.

Use this information to answer the questions below.

1. Explain why the described setup is consistent with an experimental study.
1. What are the factors? [*List all of them.*]
1. How many levels are there? [*List in same order as factors in answer b.*]
1. How many treatments are there?
1. What is the response variable?
1. What kind of variable is the response variable?
1. Physically, what is a replicate (not a number)?
1. Use a table to diagram the experimental setup. Put the unique number of each individual into respective treatments. [*Show your R work for how you placed these individuals.*]

## Fabry Disease
<img src="../zimgs/Fabry-disease.png" alt="Fabry Disease" class="img-right">

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is currently compiling a registry of patients with Fabry disease, an inherited metabolic disorder. The Fabry disease registry is open to any patient who chooses to participate and is an anonymous list. The registry includes information about the patients' health and allows doctors to follow changes in their symptoms and test results over time. It also allows doctors to compare symptoms between patients who are receiving certain therapies with those who are not receiving therapy.

1. What kind of study is this? Explain your reasoning.
