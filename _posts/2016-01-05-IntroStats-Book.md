I do not use a commercially available book for MTH107.  Instead I have written [a draft book that is freely available on the class webpage](http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/book/).  You can order a bound hard copy of the book from me on the first day of class for $25.  I will only have enough copies made for those that say they want one.  If you commit to purchase the book, then I expect that you will promptly pay me for it (I will have the books ready for those that order one on the second day of class).

You should note that this is the same book that was used last semester (Fall, 2015) and last year (Winter 2015 and Fall 2014).  It is different, however, then versions used in semesters before Fall 2014.  Thus, if you purchase a used book from someone, then make sure it is one of the most recent versions (dates are printed on the front cover).

*Please note that it makes no financial difference to me whether you purchase a hard copy of the book or not, as the $25 is the cost of photocopying and binding the book rounded up to the nearest dollar.  I am simply the "middle man" between you and the (local) photocopy company for simplicity and cost-effectiveness (i.e., I don't mark the books up like a bookstore would).*
