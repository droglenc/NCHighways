<h2>Identifying Type I and II Errors</h2>

<li>
The <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}: \mu=15.4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_{A}: \mu&gt;15.4\)</span>. A Type I error would be saying that the chicken is contaminated when it really is not contaminated. A Type II error would be saying that the chicken is not contaminated when it really is contaminated. In my mind, a Type I error is more egregious as people would be eating contaminated chicken that they have been told is not contaminated.
</li>
<li>
The <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}\)</span> is that the drug does not exceed specification whereas the <span class="math inline">\(H_{A}\)</span> is that the drug does exceed the specification. A Type I error occurs if the drug does not exceed the specifications but it concluded that it does. A Type II error occurs if the the drug does exceed the specifications but it is concluded that it does not. In my mind, a Type II error is more egregious as people would be using a “bad” drug but would have been told that it was OK.

Increasing α will INcrease power

Increasing n will INcrease power

<li>
Increasing σ will DEcrease power
</li>
<li>
Increasing how wrong the H<sub>0</sub> is will INcrease power

Effects on β

Increasing α will DEecrease β

Power may be INcreased by INcreasing n or INcreasing α.

β my be DEcreased by INcreasing n or INcreasing α.
