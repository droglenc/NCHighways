    <div class="panel-body">Becoming a college student is a profound accomplishment. It required hard work, dedication, and your commitment to finish high school, select a college, apply, enroll, and show up on day one. You should be very proud of getting this far! However, you also need to understand the many ways in which a college education differs from high school. College demands a higher level of independence, discipline, organization, cognition, and application of learning. In particular, a liberal arts education will require you to think critically and develop an interdisciplinary approach that integrates information from a variety of subject areas into a more comprehensive way of understanding the world. The purpose of this unit is to lay the groundwork for college-level academic expectations to help you acclimate to the experience of higher education and to be successful in your academic endeavors.
