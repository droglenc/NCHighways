<h1>How do I change R to SDI mode to work properly with TINN-R?</h1>
<p>The TINN-R application requires R to be in SDI mode.  The default install for R is to run in so-called MDI mode.  Thus, if you are installing R for the first time on your computer you should install it in SDI mode if you wish to use TINN-R (see <a href="obtain_R.html">this FAQ</a>).  However, if you have already installed R and are now installing TINN-R or just installed R in MDI mode by following the defaults you will need to follow the steps below to convert to SDI mode.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open R.
	<li>Select the "Edit" main menu and the "GUI Preferences" submenu.
	<li>Near the top of the ensuing dialog box select "SDI".  Then near the bottom of the dialog box select "Save".<br><br>

	<li>In the ensuing dialog box you will need to browse to the "etc" folder inside of the folder where your current version of R is installed (if you followed the defaults when installing R this will be in "Program Files/R/R-2.X.X" where the "X"s will be replaced with version numbers.  Once in this folder press "OK".  You should be asked if you want to replace an existing "RConsole.exe" -- you should answer "Yes".<br><br>

	<li>Close and re-open R.
</ol>
