    <div class="panel-body">As you may have realized by now, the workload and expectations for college courses is different than high school courses. You can do this work and meet these expectations but sometimes you need some help managing time, finding materials, or understanding certain concepts. You also need to "manage" your life (and expenses) outside of course which may require you to work with the financial aid, academic affairs, or student services offices. Finally, this may become stressful and you may want to see some help for managing that stress. In this module, you will be introduced to the many resources on campus that can help you meet your academic goals, address administrative issues and concerns, and manage stress or anxiety.
<br><br>
After completing this module, you should be able to ...

<ol>
  <li>Identify where to find academic assistance (e.g., library resources, tutoring)</li>
  <li>Identify where to find administrative assistance (e.g., finances, holds, meal plans, etc.)</li>
  <li>Identify where to find assistance for stress and anxiety.
</ol>
