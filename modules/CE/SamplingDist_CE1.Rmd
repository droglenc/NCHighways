## Constructing a Sampling Distribution
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/CE/zimgs/calculator-1.jpg" alt="Calculations" class="img-right">
Use the very simple population of five individuals with the following values -- 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 -- to answer the following questions. [*See the hints further below for how to efficiently make these calculations using R (rather than your calculator).*]

1. Compute the center and dispersion (to three decimals) of this population. Label each result with appropriate symbols.
1. Identify all possible samples of n=2 from this population. [*Note that there are 10 such samples.*]
1. Compute the mean for each sample.
1. Compute the mean of all 10 sample means.
1. Compute the standard deviation of all 10 sample means. What should this result be called?
1. Repeat the previous four questions for samples of n=3. [*Note that there is again 10 samples.*]
1. Repeat the previous question for samples of n=4. [*Note that there are 5 such samples*]
1. How did the means of the sample means change with increasing n?
1. How did the three means of sample means (i.e., from n=2, 3, and 4) compare to the population mean?
1. How did the three standard deviations of sample means compare to the population standard deviation?
1. How did the standard deviations of the sample means change with increasing n?

<p class="bg-info"><strong>Hint:</strong> the mean and standard deviation of a small set of numbers can be efficiently computed by entering the numbers into a vector in R (using <code>c()</code>) and submitting that vector to <code>Summarize()</code> from <code>NCStats</code>.</p>

```{r}
popn <- c(1,2,3,4,5)           # dummy data as an example
Summarize(popn,digits=3)       # population summaries
```

<p class="bg-info"><strong>Hint:</strong> The samples, means of each sample, and the summaries of those means can be efficiently computed from the population values entered in <code>popn</code> as shown below.</p>

```{r}
( nums2 <- combn(popn,2) )     # all combos of n=2 from popn
( mns2 <- combn(popn,2,mean) ) # mean of above (all combos of n=2)
Summarize(mns2,digits=2)       # summarized mean/sd of means
```
