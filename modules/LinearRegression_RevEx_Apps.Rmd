## Molting of Wood Thrush
<img src="zimgs/thrush.jpg" alt="Wood Thrush" class="img-right">

[Vega Rivera *et al.* (1998)](https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v110n03/p0384-p0392.pdf) examined the relationship between the duration of molt and the date of molt start (measured in days since July 1) for wood thrush (*Hylocichla mustelina*). A recreation of their results is shown below (note that the outlier marked by a "+"" in the scatterplot was ignored in the calculation of the best-fit line). Use these results to answer the questions below.

```{r FLPThrush, echo=FALSE}
molt <- data.frame(date=c(61,60,58,53,53,51,51,49,48,46,46,47,45,43,43,42,41,41,39,38,37,35,38,35,34,33,34,30,28,30,30,21,24),
                   duration=c(40,42,47,45,48,47,51,49,48,45,51,52,54,54,55,48,50,51,51,52,51,52,55,54,55,55,58,57,55,61,61,59,44))
out <- molt[33,]
molt1 <- molt[-33,]
par(mar=c(3,3,1.5,0.5),mgp=c(1.9,0.4,0),tcl=-0.2)
lm.molt <- lm(duration~date,data=molt1)
fitPlot(lm.molt,pch=21,bg="gray70",
        xlab="Start Date (d since July 1)",ylab="Duration (d))")
points(out$date,out$duration,pch=3)
r2 <- formatC(rSquared(lm.molt),format="f",digits=3)
mtext(bquote(paste(Y==.(formatC(coef(lm.molt)[1],format="f",digits=3))-.(formatC(-1*coef(lm.molt)[2],format="f",digits=3))*X,"    ",r^2==.(r2))),line=0.2,cex=0.8)
```

## Age and Systolic Blood Pressure
<img src="zimgs/bloodpressure.jpg" alt="Blood Pressure" class="img-right">

The age (in years) and systolic blood pressure were measured for 32 white males over the age of 40. The researchers wanted to determine if systolic blood pressure increased with increasing age. Thus, they computed the regression depicted in the fitted-line plot below. Use these results to answer the questions below.

```{r FLPAgeSBP, echo=FALSE}
sbp1 <- data.frame(age=c(43,41,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,50,49,48,51,53,52,54,54,54,57,56,56,56,58,59,60,62,64,63,65,63,64),
                   sbp=c(120,122,126,144,135,142,129,133,130,132,134,145,160,138,137,149,149,146,141,135,138,142,150,144,166,162,152,152,161,164,170,180))
par(mar=c(3,3,1.5,0.5),mgp=c(1.9,0.4,0),tcl=-0.2)
lm.sbp <- lm(sbp~age,data=sbp1)
fitPlot(lm.sbp,pch=21,bg="gray70",
        xlab="Age (yrs)",ylab="Systolic Blood Pressure")
r2 <- rSquared(lm.sbp)
mtext(bquote(paste(Y==.(formatC(coef(lm.sbp)[1],format="f",digits=3))+.(formatC(coef(lm.sbp)[2],format="f",digits=3))*X,"    ",r^2==.(formatC(r2,format="f",digits=3)))),line=0.2,cex=0.8)

## TV Ratings
<img src="zimgs/tv.jpg" alt="TV" class="img-right">

There are at least two ways that special TV programs could be rated, and both are of interest to advertisers -- the estimated size of the audience and the percentage of TV-owning households that tuned into the program. Use the results below for the 20 all-time top-rated programs to determine if the estimated size of the audience can be predicted from the percentage of TV-owning households tuned into the program.

```{r FLPTV, echo=FALSE}
tv <- data.frame(rating=c(60.3,53.3,51.1,48.6,46,48.3,48.6,49.1,45.8,46.5,46.5,46,46.3,45.9,47,47.3,47.4,47.7,46.5,45.9),
                 audience=c(50247,41481,36296,45679,44074,41605,40617,40000,40123,39506,38765,38642,35432,32716,35062,34444,33580,33827,27284,25679))

r2 <- formatC(rSquared(lm.tv),format="f",digits=3)
mtext(bquote(paste(Y==.(formatC(coef(lm.tv)[1],format="f",digits=3))+.(formatC(coef(lm.tv)[2],format="f",digits=3))*X,"    ",r^2==.(r2))),line=0.2,cex=0.8)
```

## Deer Fawns
<img src="zimgs/fawn.jpg" alt="Fawn" class="img-right">

Wildlife ecologists in Texas wanted to determine if the number of fawns born to each doe could be explained by the doe's body mass [(Ginnett and Young 2000)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3802741?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). As part of their study, the researchers recorded the mean number of fawns born to a doe (over a period of time) and the body mass of the doe (kg). Use the results in the following graph to explain the relationship to answer the questions below.

```{r FLPFawns, echo=FALSE}
