## Normal Distribution Characteristics II

For each situation below, draw the normal distribution with an approximately accurate scale on the x-axis

1. x~N(75,10)
1. y~N(5500,600)
1. z~N(0,1)

    1. What percent of x values are between 65 and 85?
    1. What percent of x values are between 55 and 85?
    1. What is the value x such that 2.5% of x values are lower?
    1. What is the most common 95% of x values?
    1. What is the largest 2.5% of x values?
1. For z~N(0,1)
