## P-Value Calculations and Decisions

For each situation below, (i) write a sentence that defines the p-value specific to that situation, (ii) compute the p-value (include a drawing to support your calculation), and (iii) make a decision about H<sub>0</sub>.

1. &alpha;=0.05, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;<80, n=30, &sigma;=20, x&#772;=73.
1. &alpha;=0.05, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;&#8800;1500, n=40, &sigma;=800, x&#772;=1370.

## Beetle Size
<img src="zimgs/beetle.jpg" alt="Beetle" class="img-right">
Researchers examined the size of two different species of beetles. They hypothesized that the thorax length of the *Halticus oleracea* species would be greater than 190 &mu;m. The data for their study is in Beetles.csv ([file](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/Beetles.csv), [meta](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/blob/master/Beetles_meta.txt)).  Use this information to answer the questions below. [*Note that you will need to filter the data set to just the Halticus oleracea species of beetle (this must be done in R).*]

1. construct statistical hypotheses, 
1. compute the sample mean, 
1. compute the p-value assuming that &sigma;=14, 
1. make a decision about the hypotheses using &alpha;=0.05, and 
1. summarize your findings in terms of the beetle's thorax size.
