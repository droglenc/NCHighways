## Forest Composition
<img src="../zimgs/forestcomp.jpg" alt="Forest Composition" class="img-right">
Hely *et al.* (2000; Journal of Vegetation Science 11:813-824) examined the effects of stand composition on fire hazard in mixed-wood Canadian boreal forests.  Two variables that they recorded for each stand were stand type (`sttype`, where `d`=deciduous, `c`=coniferous, `mc`=mixed coniferous, and `md`=mixed deciduous) and the time since the last fire (`tslf`) which was treated as a categorical variable with the categories corresponding to 100 year blocks of time (i.e., `0-100`, `100-200`, etc.).  These data may be found in [Fire.csv](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/Fire.csv).  Use these data to determine if the distribution of times since last fire differs by type of forest stand.  [Note: **refactor** `sttype` so that the `c` and `d` levels are ordered at the ends (i.e., so that the categories are arranged from mostly coniferous to mostly deciduous).]

## Popularity in Middle School
<img src="../zimgs/sports_kids_3.jpg" alt="Sports Kids" class="img-right">
[Chase and Drummer (1992)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1439167) examined sports as a social status determinant for children.  In their study, they surveyed 227 boys and 251 girls in grades 4, 5, and 6 from schools in Michigan to determine which criteria were most important in determining personal, female, and male popularity.  In one part of their study, students were asked what their personal goals were for school (options were "make good grades", "be popular", and "be good in sports"; `goals`).  These data (and answers to several other questions) are in [PopularKids.csv](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/PopularKids.csv).  Use these data to determine if student's goals differ among the grade levels.
