H<sub>A</sub>: “The distribution of students into the goals categories differs for at least one pair of grades” and H<sub>O</sub>: “The distribution of students into the goals categories DOES NOT differ among grades”.

<li>
Chi-square test because (i) two or more groups or populations (grades) were sampled and (ii) the response variable (goals category) is categorial.
</li>
<li>
This is an observational study because the students were not allocated to grades. The students were not obviously randomly selected (and were likely part of a voluntary response survey).
</li>
<li>
All cells in the expected frequency table (Table 1) were greater than 5; the assumptions for a chi-square test have been met.

It appears that the distributions of goals by students does not differ by grade. Analysis of the row percentage table (Table 4) suggests that grades are the primary goal for each grade.

H<sub>A</sub>: “The distribution of stands into the times since last fire differs for at least one pair of stand types” and H<sub>O</sub>: “The distribution of stands into the times since last fire DOES NOT differ among stand types”.

<li>
Chi-square test because (i) two or more groups or populations (stand types) were sampled and (ii) the response variable (time since last fire) is categorial (in the way it was recorded).
</li>
<li>
This is an observational study because the stand type was not set or manipulated by the researcher. The stands were not obviously randomly selected.

All cells in the expected frequency table (Table 5) were NOT greater than 5. The p-value calculation below is suspect.
