## Loading Data from Webpage I
Download the BrainHead.csv data file from the class webpage into your "R Directory", load the data into a data.frame in R, and identify (i) how many variables, (ii) the names of the variables, and (iii) how many individuals are in the data.frame.

## Loading Your Own Data I
Record three variables (at least one quantitative and one categorical) about at least five individuals in this classroom. [*Don't be shy*] Enter these data into a CSV file, load the data into a data.frame in R, and make sure that there are as many variables and individuals as you expect and that the variables are named as you expect.
