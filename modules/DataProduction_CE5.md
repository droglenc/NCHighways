## Study Types II
For each question below, identify (and explain why) whether it represents an observational or experimental study.

1. In 2001 [a report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute](http://bogbit.com/does-working-night-shifts-increase-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/) indicated that women who work at night have a 60% greater risk of developing breast cancer. Researchers based these findings on the work histories of 763 women with breast cancer and 741 women without the disease.
1. [Helle *et al.* (2002)](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/296/5570/1085.full?ijkey=4842612ad61bcf9386845ff5a129be9ae15c158f&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha) reported on a study of women in Finland that indicated that having sons shortened the lifespan of mothers by about 34 weeks per son, but that daughters helped to lengthen the mothersâ€™ lives. The data came from church records from the period 1640 to 1870.
1. Some gardeners prefer to use nonchemical methods to control insect pests in their gardens. Researchers have designed two kinds of traps and want to know which design will be more effective. They randomly choose 10 locations in a large garden and place one of each kind of trap at each location. After a week, they count the number of bugs in each trap.
