## Raptors at Hawk Ridge
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/zimgs/hawk_ridge.jpg" alt="Hawk Ridge" class="img-right">
The Duluth, MN Tourism Board would like to advertise that, on average, more than 50,000 raptors are seen at [Hawk Ridge](http://www.hawkridge.org/) per year.  The numbers of various raptor species was observed from 1971-2003 and recorded in HawksRidge.csv ([file](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/HawksRidge.csv), [meta](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/blob/master/HawksRidge_meta.txt)).  Note that the `Total` variable should be used here as the Board is focused on the total number of raptors seen in a year.  Further, assume that it is known that the population standard deviation is 37,000 raptors per year.  The board wants there to be strong, if any, evidence to support their claim (i.e., test at the 1% level).  Determine if these data support the Board's claim.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).
