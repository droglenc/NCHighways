## Random Jury Pool?
<img src="../zimgs/jury-box.jpg" alt="Jury Box" class="img-right">
A defense attorney claimed that a jury pool is not representative of the larger population in the court's district.  In particular, she was concerned that the jury pool contained fewer "young people" than would be expected based on district demographics.  To test her claim, she created seven age categories, counted the number of individuals from the jury pool in each age category, and found the percentage of the district in each age category from the most recent census data.  Her findings are below.[^1]

<pre>
Ages         18-19    20-24    25-29    30-39    40-49    50-64      65+
Jury Pool       23       96      134      293      297      380      113
District      6.1%    15.0%    13.5%    21.7%    15.3%    18.2%    10.2%
</pre>

Use these results to determine, at the 10% level, if the age distribution in the jury pool accurately represents the age distriction of the district as a whole.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).  Also comment on whether the attorney's specific concern was warranted.
