## Identifying Hypotheses

For each research hypothesis or statement below, construct the null and alternative hypotheses (use their respective symbols) and explicitly define the parameter in the hypotheses.

1. The mean number of murders per burrough in New York City in 2010 was less than 90.
1. Washburn High School publicizes that 61% of its students are invovled in at least one extracurricular activity.  A parent organization believes that the percentage is higher.
1. The Toyota dealership has advertised that oil changes will be completed in 15 minutes or less.  Test whether their advertisement is incorrect.
1. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases reports that the average 
cost of bariatric (weight loss) surgery is $22,500.  You think that this information is incorrect.

## P-Value Calculations and Decisions

Compute the p-value and make a decision about H<sub>0</sub> for each situation below.

1. &alpha;=0.10, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;>75, n=50, &sigma;=12, <span class="serif">x&#772;</span>=80.5.

## Identifying Type I and II Errors

In each situation below, describe what a Type I and a Type II error is and make an argument for which error is more egregious.  [*Hint: begin by identifying the H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>A</sub>.*]

1. The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) limit for salmonella contamination for chicken is 20%.  A meat inspector reports that the chicken produced by a company exceeds the USDA limit.  You perform a hypothesis test to determine whether the meat inspectorâ€™s claim is true.
1. The process of manufacturing a certain drug is quite complex.  Small departures from the standard procedure can result in a drug that does not meet specifications and is dangerous to the user.  Before being released for use a sample of a batch of the drug is tested to determine if a particular chemical in the drug exceeds specifications.
