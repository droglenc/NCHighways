## Checking the CLT
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/zimgs/computer-1.jpg" alt="Simulations" class="img-right">
Repeat [Class Exercise 3](SamplingDist_CE3.html) for each situation below (which corresponds to the situations in the [previous exercise](SamplingDist_CE4.html)).

----

## Situation 2
The population is constructed by using `shape1=1` and `shape2=5` in `cltSim()`.

1. What did you observed about the sampling distribution of the sample means for each of n=10, 25, and 50. Record your observations in the appropriate cells of a table like that above.
1. Did each of your observations match your expectations (from the previous exercise)? Does this give you confidence in the CLT?

## Situation 3
The population is constructed by using `shape1=5` and `shape2=3` in `cltSim()`.

1. What did you observed about the sampling distribution of the sample means for each of n=10, 25, and 50. Record your observations in the appropriate cells of a table like that above.
1. Did each of your observations match your expectations (from the previous exercise)? Does this give you confidence in the CLT?
