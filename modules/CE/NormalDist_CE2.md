1. What proportion of students cannot get accepted by School A?
1. What percentage of students can get accepted by School B?

## Urban Deer Relocations
<img src="zimgs/urban-deer.jpg" alt="Urban Deer" class="img-right">

Relocation methods for controlling the overpopulation of Whitetail Deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*) in urban areas is controversial. Animal rights organizations like the idea because they believe deer are unharmed in this manner, but scientists suspect that translocation can have a higher mortality rate than hunting or culling. On this note, researchers in Wanakena, New York wanted to examine the home-range sizes of resident and translocated female deer ([Jones *et al.* 1997](http://www.porter.fw.msu.edu/Jones%20et%20al%201997%20-%20Translocation%20of%20Deer.pdf)). The average home range size was 0.30 km<sup>2</sup>, with a standard deviation of 0.095 km<sup>2</sup>, for 39 translocated does in the Dubuar Forest between 1994 and 1995. Assume that the distribution of home range sizes is normal. Use this information to answer the questions below.

1. What proportion of deer have home range sizes between 0.2 and 0.4 km<sup>2</sup>?
1. What proportion of deer have a home range size greater than 0.32 km<sup>2</sup>?
1. How big is the home range such that 17% of deer have a larger home range?
1. How big is the home range such that 32% of deer have a smaller home range?
1. What proportion of deer have a home range size less than 0.4 km<sup>2</sup>?
1. Between what two sizes of home ranges do the most common 48% of deer inhabit?
