## Lights and Nearsightedness
<img src="zimgs/nightlight.jpg" alt="Nightlight" class="img-right">

An Associated Press article captured the attention of readers with the headline "Night lights bad for kids?" The article was based on [a 1999 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1115762/) at the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, in which parents were surveyed about the lighting conditions under which their children slept between birth and age-2 (lamp, night-light, or no light) and whether or not their children developed nearsightedness (myopia). The purpose of their study was to explore the effect of a young child’s nighttime exposure to light on later nearsightedness. The results from 479 children were recorded in nightlight.csv ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/nightlight.csv), [meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/nightlight_meta.txt)). Use these data to answer the following questions. [*Make sure to refer to properly labeled tables for each question*]

1. How many children in the sample slept in ``no light'' conditions and developed nearsightedness?
1. What percentage of children that slept in ``no light'' conditions developed nearsightedness?
1. What percentage of all children slept with a ``lamp'' and developed nearsightedness?
1. What percentage of children that slept with a ``night light'' that did not develop nearsightedness?
1. What percentage of children that developed nearsightedness slept with a ``lamp''?
1. What percentage of children developed nearsightedness?
1. Make an overall conclusion about how the different light conditions affected the development of nearsightedness in the children.
