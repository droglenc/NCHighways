## Driving Speed
<img src="../zimgs/speedlimit.jpg" alt="Speed Limit" class="img-right">
A police officer in Kansas has recorded the amount of time it takes cars to travel between two points.  In a large sample of cars he found the mean time to be 2.5 s with a standard deviation of 0.75 s.  Treat these results as if they represent a population and are normally distributed.

  From this, answer the following questions.

1. What is an individual?
1. What is the variable?
1. What type of variable is that?
1. What is mu?
1. What is sigma?

Additionally, for each questions below (a) identify the type of question (e.g., "forward-left", "reverse-between") and then (b) answer the question.

1. What is the time that identifies the slowest 15% of drivers?
1. What proportion of drivers pass through the two points in less than 1 s?
1. What proportion of drivers pass through the two points in between 1.5 and 4.5 s?
1. What is the IQR for time to pass between the two points?
1. What proportion of drivers pass through the two points in more than 7 s?
1. What is the median time to pass between the two points?
