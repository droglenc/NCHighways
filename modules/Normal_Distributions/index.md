Many natural phenomena can be closely approximated by simple statistical distributions.  The most common of these distributions is the normal distribution, most often referred to by laypeople as the "bell-shaped curve."  Because of its prevalence, the normal distribution is the foundation of many statistical methods.  This module describes how to make calculations with a normal distribution.  These calculations are useful in their own right, but they also form the foundation for many of the methods used in later modules.

<p>After completing this module, you should be able to ...</p>

<ol>
  <li>Describe the shape, center, and dispersion of a normal distribution.</li>
  <li>Explain the physical characteristics of a normal distribution that are represented by the mean and standard deviation.</li>
  <li>Estimate percentages of individuals and values of variables using the 68-95-99.7 Rule.</li>
  <li>Identify the difference between "forward" and "reverse" types of calculations.</li>
  <li>Accurately make "forward" calculations with R.</li>
  <li>Accurately make "reverse" calculations with R.</li>
