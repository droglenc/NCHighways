<h2>Identifying Type I and II Errors</h2>
<p>In each situation below, describe what a Type I and a Type II error is and make an argument for which error is more egregious. [<em>Hint: begin by identifying the H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>A</sub>.</em>]</p>
<ol>
<li>The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) limit for salmonella contamination for chicken is 20%. A meat inspector reports that the chicken produced by a company exceeds the USDA limit. You perform a hypothesis test to determine whether the meat inspectorâ€™s claim is true.</li>
<li>The process of manufacturing a certain drug is quite complex. Small departures from the standard procedure can result in a drug that does not meet specifications and is dangerous to the user. Before being released for use a sample of a batch of the drug is tested to determine if a particular chemical in the drug exceeds specifications.</li>

<h2>Understanding Power Relationships</h2>
<p><img src="../zimgs/computer-1.jpg" alt="Simulations" class="img-right"> The probability of a type II error (β) and power cannot be computed because the true population mean (μ<sub>a</sub>) is not known. However, β and power are affected by α, n, σ, and “how wrong” the null hypothesized value is. Simulations with known populations can be used to understand the relationships between β, power, and these other values. Because α and n are chosen by the statistician, decisions can be made that will affect the values of β and power (though we will never know the actual values of &amp;beta and power).</p>
<p>The <code>powerSim()</code> function (with no arguments) from <code>NCStats</code> provides an efficient method to perform these simulations. For example, <code>powerSim()</code> produced the plots shown below. create a known population, repeatedly sample (5000 times) from that population, and summarize the resulting simulated sampling distribution. The histogram on the left is a known population distribution with the parameters (μ&amp;σ) shown. The histogram on the right is a simulated sampling distribution; i.e., the distribution of means from 5000 independent samples of size n taken from the known population. In RStudio, this plot will have a gear icon in the upper-left corner that will open a dialog box that allows you to modify n. Additionally, you can control two shape parameters that will alter the known population distribution.</p>
