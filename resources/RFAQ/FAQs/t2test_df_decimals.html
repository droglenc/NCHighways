<h1>The df for my two-sample t-test contains decimals.</h1>
<p>There are two types of two-sample t-tests -- (1) variances are equal and (2) variances are unequal.  In our introductory statistics course we only discussed the equal variances case.  In the equal variances case the degrees-of-freedom are n<sub>1</sub>+n<sub>2</sub>-2.  In the unequal variances case the degrees-of-freedom are computed from a more complicated formula that often results in fractions (decimals) of degrees-of-freedom.  Thus, if you expected the two-sample t-test degrees-of-freedom to be n<sub>1</sub>+n<sub>2</sub>-2 then you forgot to set <font face="Courier New" color="#FF0000">var.equal=TRUE</font> in <font face="Courier New" color="#FF0000">t.test()</font>.  Of course, before doing this you should verify with <font face="Courier New" color="#FF0000">Levenes()</font> that the variances are statistically equal</p>

<p>The following is the unequal variances two-sample t-test (note that the unequal variances version is also called the Welch two-sample t-test)</p>
<pre><font color="#FF0000">> t.test(extra ~ group)</font>
<font color="#0000FF">        Welch Two Sample t-test
data:  extra by group 
t = -1.8608, df = 17.776, p-value = 0.0794
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 
95 percent confidence interval:
 -3.3654832  0.2054832 
sample estimates:
mean in group 1 mean in group 2 
           0.75            2.33</font></pre>

<p>The following is the same test constructed as an equal variances two-sample t-test</p>
<pre><font color="#FF0000">> Levenes(extra~group)</font>
<font color="#0000FF">Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance
      Df F value p-value
group  1  0.2482 0.62437
      18 </font>
<font color="#FF0000">> t.test(extra ~ group,var.equal=TRUE)</font>
<font color="#0000FF">        Two Sample t-test
data:  extra by group 
t = -1.8608, df = 18, p-value = 0.07919
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 
95 percent confidence interval:
 -3.3638740  0.2038740 
sample estimates:
mean in group 1 mean in group 2 
           0.75            2.33</font></pre>

<p>Notice the difference in degrees-of-freedom between the two tests.</p>
