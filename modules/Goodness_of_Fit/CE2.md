## Habitat Use by Wild Turkeys
<img src="../zimgs/merriam-turkey.jpg" alt="Merriam's Turkey" class="img-right">
[Rumble and Anderson (1992)](http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_1992_rumble_m002.pdf) examined habitat use by [Merriam's Wild Turkey (*Meleagris gallopavo merriami*)](http://wildturkeyzone.com/wildturkey/merriams.htm) in South Dakota.  In one part of their study they identified the major vegetative type (called Habitat below) in 4-32 hectare sampling units.  They then computed the proportions of total area available to turkeys by major vegetation type (first row below).  Turkeys' were trapped and fit with radio transmitters.  Each bird was then located three times per week with the location of the bird being recorded.  The frequency of locations by each major vegatation type was computed for each of four seasons.  The area available and the seasonal frequency of turkey locations in each habitat are shown below.

<pre>
Habitat             Aspen    Meadow     Pine       Oak     Spruce
Area Avaialable    0.0516    0.1016    0.8371    0.0044    0.0056
Winter Use             4        11       186         4         0         
Spring Use            61         9       807         0         1
Summer Use            17         5       100         1         3
Fall Use              14         7       195         1         1
</pre>

Use these results to determine if the turkey's exhibited a habitat preference in the **Spring**.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).
