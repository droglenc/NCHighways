<p>Balancing daily and weekly tasks can be a big challenge for college students. Life in college is typically much less structured than high school, and therefore students may have a difficult time keeping themselves organized and making effective use of their time. By unit 6, students are beginning to develop habits that will likely stay with them throughout their college career. Therefore, it is important to equip them with the tools necessary to be organized, disciplined, and thorough with their school work and other commitments on campus. Likewise, now that students are becoming accustomed to life on campus, this is a good time in the semester for them to take a closer look at the many resources and technologies available to them on campus. The purpose of this unit is to bring studentsâ€™ awareness to their current time-management habits, and help them identify areas to improve, in order to best manage their overall stress level in college.</p>
