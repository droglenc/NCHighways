## Fecal Coliform Counts II
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/zimgs/warning_sign.jpg" alt="Checking out" class="img-right">
Students recorded fecal coliform counts (number of colony forming units (CFU) per 100 ml) in water samples from a nearby lake following a rainstorm with considerable runoff.  The results from their samples are shown below.

```{r echo=FALSE}
Summarize(~CFU,data=df,digits=2)[-10]
```

Test, at the 1% level, if these results differ from the mean of 162 CFU/100ml predicted from a computer model.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).

## Fecal Coliform Counts II
The students' data was recorded in [FecalColiform.csv](FecalColiform.csv).  Use these data to determine, at the 10% level, if the mean CFU from this event exceeds 150 CFU/100ml, which is the threshold for clsoing the lake to swimming.  Again, make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).
