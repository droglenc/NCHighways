    <div class="panel-heading">Getting Involved on Campus and in the Community</div>
    <div class="panel-body">Being successful in college is about more than attending class and getting good grades. While academic commitment is critically important, it is also important to be engaged in campus life and the surrounding community so as to cultivate a sense of place and purpose, and to maintain a healthy school-life balance. Connecting with peers and participating in activities on campus is an essential component of developing such a balance. Likewise you may find it fulfilling to help others within the larger Ashland and Chequamegon Bay communities.
