<p>Developing a strong sense of place is essential to being a successful college student. This means not only connecting to the physical space and people around them, but also understanding the history, values, and mission of the institution of which they are now a part. When students feel connected to the institution, they develop a stronger sense of pride, identity, and purpose in their work. Ultimately, such a connection can lead to greater academic success and persistence to graduation. The purpose of this unit is to connect students what Northland is all aboutâ€”our history, values, mission, and what it means to be a lumber(human)!</p>
