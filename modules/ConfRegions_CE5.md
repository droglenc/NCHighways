## Confidence Region Calculations II

For each situation below, (a) identify the level of confidence; (b) whether a lower confidence bound, upper confidence bound, or confidence interval should be constructed; (c) find Z<sup>*</sup> (include a drawing that illustrates your calculation); (d) construct the confidence region; and (e) specifically interpret the confidence region.

1. &alpha;=0.01, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;&#8800;800, n=25, &sigma;=60, x&#772;=824.

## Radius of Jupiter
<img src="zimgs/jupiter.jpg" alt="Jupiter" class="img-right">
Researchers measured the equatorial radius of [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter) 40 different times.  The method used is largely without bias but there is measurement-to-measurement variability.  In fact, &sigma; is assumed to be 28 km.  The mean of the 40 measurements was 71492 km.  From this, (i) construct an appropriate confidence **interval** assuming that &alpha;=0.01 and (ii) specifically interpret your findings.[^2]

## Blood Pressure in Children
<img src="zimgs/bloodpressure2.jpg" alt="Blood Pressure" class="img-right">

An investigator wants to estimate the mean systolic blood pressure in children with congenital heart disease who are between the ages of 3 and 5.  The investigator plans on using a 99% confidence interval and desires a margin of error of 5 units.  The standard deviation of systolic blood pressure is unknown, but the investigator conducted a literature review and found that the standard deviation of systolic blood pressures in children with other cardiac defects is between 15 and 20.[^2]

1. Use this information to construct a "worst-case scenario" required sample size.
1. How would the required sample size change for the "best-case scenario".
