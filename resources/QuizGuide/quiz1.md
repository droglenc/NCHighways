The first Quiz on Wednesday 29-Jan will cover material from Module 1 (*Why Statistics Is Important*), Module 2 (*Foundational Definitions*), Module 3 (*Data Production*), Module 6 (*Summaries for One Quantitative Variable*), and Module 7 (*Univariate EDA - Quantitative*). There will be **no** questions regarding R or that will use R. The quiz is primarily application questions but several short answer essay questions will also be asked. Any material in the module readings and videos (specifically questions on the preparation guides), exercises (most completed in class), or review exercises may be on the quiz.

* Five short answer essay (2-4 sentences) questions. Three of these are from Module 1 (*Why Statistics Is Important*), one is from Module 2 (*Foundational Definitions*), and one is from Module 3 (*Data Production*). All of these questions were either part of the exercises or on a module preparation guide.
* Identify the type of variable ... [like this](../../../modules/CE/FoundationalDefns_CE.html#types-of-variables-i) in Module 2 (*Foundational Definitions*).
* Perform an IVPPSS analysis ... [like this](../../modules/CE/FoundationalDefns_CE.html#sustainability-survey) (and others) in Module 2 (*Foundational Definitions*).
* Determine if a situation represents an experiment or an observational study ... [like this](../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE1.html#study-types-i) in Module 3 (*Data Production*).
* Determine the type of observational study ... [like this](../../modules/CE/../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE1.html#types-of-observational-studies-i) in Module 3 (*Data Production*).
* Identify the response and explanatory variables ... [like this](../../modules/CE/../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE1.html#identify-response-and-explanatory-variables-i) in Module 3 (*Data Production*).
* Identify key components of an experiment ... [like this](../../modules/CE/../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE1.html#blood-pressure-study) (among others) in Module 3 (*Data Production*).
* Compute the mean and standard deviation for 4-6 numbers ... [like this](../../modules/CE/UEDAQuant1_CE.html#hand-calculations) in Module 6 (*Summaries for One Quantitative Variable*).
* Compute the median and IQR for 12-20 numbers ... [like this](../../modules/CE/UEDAQuant1_CE.html.html#hand-calculations) in Module 6 (*Summaries for One Quantitative Variale*).
* Perform a univariate EDA for a quantitative variable from a provided histogram and table of summary statistics ... [like this](../../modules/CE/UEDAQuant2_CE1.html#communit-times) (and others) in Module 7 (*Univariate EDA - Quantitative*).

I strongly believe that the best way to prepare for this quiz is by ...

1. Reviewing what you did on the exercises. I would carefully compare your answers to the answer keys that are now available. Also pay close attention to the "notes" that I have placed in yellow boxes in the answer keys.
1. Practice more exercises, either in the "more as time permits" links for some modules or in the review exercises for all modules. Focus on questions that are similar to the ones linked to in the list above.
1. Start practicing early so that if you have questions you can get help from me or from [the tutors](Syllabus-Current.html#tutors) (who have tutor hours on the Sunday and the Tuesday before the quiz).

The quiz is closed book, closed notes, etc. You should bring a calculator and you MUST use a pencil. Quizzes written in red ink will not be accepted and will earn a zero. The quiz will begin promptly at 1000 and must be turned in by 1150.

Please let me know if you have any questions about this quiz.
