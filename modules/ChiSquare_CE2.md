## Forest Composition
<img src="zimgs/forestcomp.jpg" alt="Forest Composition" class="img-right">
Hely *et al.* (2000; Journal of Vegetation Science 11:813-824) examined the effects of stand composition on fire hazard in mixed-wood Canadian boreal forests.  Two variables that they recorded for each stand were stand type (`sttype`, where `d`=deciduous, `c`=coniferous, `mc`=mixed coniferous, and `md`=mixed deciduous) and the time since the last fire (`tslf`) which was treated as a categorical variable with the categories corresponding to 100 year blocks of time (i.e., `0-100`, `100-200`, etc.).  Use the data in [Fire.csv](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/Fire.csv) to determine, at the 5% level, if the distribution of times since last fire differed by type of forest stand.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](11-steps.html).  [Note: **refactor** `sttype` so that the `c` and `d` levels are ordered at the ends (i.e., so that the categories are arranged from mostly coniferous to mostly deciduous).] [Further Note: please **continue** with all steps even though the assumptions are not met with these data.]
