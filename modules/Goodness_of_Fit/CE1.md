## Preference for Bottled Water?
<img src="../zimgs/bottled-water-waste.jpg" alt="Scales of Justice" class="img-right">
Students in an Introduction to Environmental Studies course conducted a study to determine preferences (or not) for bottled water.  In one part of their study, a sample of students were given four samples of water in clear unmarked cups.  The water was either from the local water source (tap water) or bottled water from Aquafina, Fiji, or Sam's Choice.  Each subject tried each sample of water, without knowing which type they were trying, and then recorded the type that they "most preferred."  They found that 51, 18, 17, and 21 subjects most preferred the tap water, Aquafina, Fiji, and Sam's Choice options, respectively.  Use these results to determine if there is any differences in the most preferred choices of water.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).[^1]
