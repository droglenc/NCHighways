## Carpenter Ants

Suppose that the distribution of number of Carpenter Ants in a nest is known to be N(1400,300).  From this, answer the following questions.

1. What is an individual?
1. What is the variable?
1. What type of variable is that?
1. What is mu?
1. What is sigma?

Additionally, for each question below (a) identify the type of question (e.g., "forward-left", "reverse-between") and then (b) answer the question.

6. What percentage of nests have more than 1900 ants?
1. What is the number of ants such that 15% of nests have more ants?
1. What is the number of ants such that 33% of nests have fewer ants?
1. What percentage of nests have between 700 and 1900 ants?
1. What percentage of nests have fewer than 300 ants?
1. What is the number of ants such that 5% of nests have more ants?
1. The most common 80% of nests have between what two numbers of ants?

## Pollen Counts

Suppose that it is known that the distribution of the total weed pollen count (spores per cubic meter of air) for LaCrosse, WI on a day in early September is approximately normal with a mean of 40 and a standard deviation of 8.  [Note that pollen count information is available from [this site](http://www.aaaai.org/nab/index.cfm?p=allergenreport&stationid=28).]

For each questions below (a) identify the type of question (e.g., "forward-left", "reverse-between") and then (b) answer the question.

1. What is the number of pores/m<sup>3</sup> such that 10% of the days have higher pore counts?
1. What proportion of days in LaCrosse have a weed pollen count less than 50 pores/$m^{3}$?
1. What proportion of days in LaCrosse have a weed pollen count between 32 and 55 pores/$m^{3}$?
1. What is the number of pores/$m^{3}$ such that 30% of the days have lower pore counts?
1. What is the most common 70% of number of pores/$m^{3}$?
1. What proportion of days in LaCrosse have a weed pollen count greater than 35 pores/$m^{3}$?

## Driving Speed
<img src="../zimgs/speedlimit.jpg" alt="Speed Limit" class="img-right">
A police officer in Kansas has recorded the amount of time it takes cars to travel between two points.  In a large sample of cars he found the mean time to be 2.5 s with a standard deviation of 0.75 s.  Treat these results as if they represent a population and are normally distributed.

For each questions below (a) identify the type of question (e.g., "forward-left", "reverse-between") and then (b) answer the question.

1. What is the time that identifies the slowest 15% of drivers?
1. What proportion of drivers pass through the two points in less than 1 s?
1. What proportion of drivers pass through the two points in between 1.5 and 4.5 s?
1. What is the IQR for time to pass between the two points?
1. What proportion of drivers pass through the two points in more than 7 s?
1. What is the median time to pass between the two points?
