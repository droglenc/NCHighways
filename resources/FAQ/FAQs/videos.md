Many of the class modules have links to YouTube or Vimeo videos as part of the class preparation materials. Some students have reported some issues with watching these videos. Below are some hints that have helped others in the past. Please [let me know](mailto:derek@derekogle.com) if these solutions don't work for you or if you have found other solutions.

## Vimeo Videos
The Vimeo videos are produced by me and will require you to use the password of "**NCStats**" (note capitalization and don't use the quotes) to view. These vidoes may also have PowerPoint or other icons following the link to the video. These icons links to materials that were used in the video. You may find it useful to see or print these materials (for taking notes on) as you watch the video.

Here is a sample:

* Video: [Randomization in R](https://vimeo.com/user45324800/random-numbers){:target="_blank"} [3 mins] [![Web](../../../img/web.png)](../../../modules/DataProduction_RHO.html){:target="_blank"}  [![PDF](../../../img/pdf.png)](../../../modules/DataProduction_RHO.pdf) [![MSWord](../../../img/word.png)](../../../modules/DataProduction_RHO.docx)  [![R](../../../img/Rlogo.png)](../../../modules/DataProduction_RHO.R){:target="_blank"}


## YouTube Videos
It appears that the videos open without any issues in Internet Explorer. However, in Firefox and Chrome, the videos do not play automatically and may even appear to not exist. In all cases that I have tested, the videos will load if I put the cursor in the web address bar and press Enter. In Chrome, the videos will also play if I press the RELOAD button.

Here is a sample:

* Video: [Types of Conclusions](https://www.youtube.com/v/5zkg1w5zoQ0?version=3&autoplay=1&start=1597){:target="_blank"} [3 mins]
