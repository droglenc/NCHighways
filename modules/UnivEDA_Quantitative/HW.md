## Effluent Sampling Labs
<img src="../zimgs/effluent-samples.jpg" alt="Effluent Samples" class="img-right">

Municipal wastewater treatment plants are required by law to monitor their discharges into rivers and streams on a regular basis. Concern about the reliability of data from one of these self-monitoring programs led to a study in which samples of effluent were divided and sent to two labs -- a State of Wisconsin lab and a private commercial lab. Each lab measured the Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) on the effluent sample sent to them. Enter these data (in stacked format with two columns labeled `lab` and `bod`) into a CSV file and read into an object named `df` in R.

<pre>
State -- 6,6,8,11,18,20,28,33,34,43,71
Private -- 15,25,28,29,34,35,36,39,42,44,54
</pre>

1. Perform separate appropriate EDAs for each lab. Refer to figures and tables as appropriate. [*HINT: You may construct a figure for each lab with just one R command. One command may also be used to construct a table that contains results for each lab.*]
1. Comment on two MAJOR differences in the results from the two labs?
