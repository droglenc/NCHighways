<h2>Equation of the Line</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dishwasher Example</strong>
<ol>
<li>response - Height of suds (mm)</li>
<li>explanatory - Amount of soap (g)</li>
<li>slope is 12.4</li>
<li>intercept is -20.2</li>
<li>For each additional gram of soap, the height of sudes increases by 12.4 mm, on average.</li>
<li>For 0 grams of soap, the height of suds is -20.2 mm, on average. [<em>This is an extrapolation.</em>]</li>
<li>Ask to predict height of suds for an amount of soap between 3.5 and 8.0 grams. Example … “What is the predicted height of suds for 5 g of soap?” Answer … -20.2+12.4*5=41.8 mm.</li>
<li>Ask to predict height of sudes for an amount of soap not between 3.5 and 8.0 grams. Example … “What is the predicted height of suds for 10 g of soap?”</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Livestock Food Example</strong>
<ol>
<li>response - Costs</li>
<li>explanatory - Livestock food mix in pounds</li>
<li>Slope is 190.</li>
<li>Intercept is 12075</li>
<li>For each additional ton of the food mix, the cost increases by $190, on average.</li>
<li>For 0 tons of the food mix, the costs are $12075, on average. [<em>This may be considered as “start-up” costs.</em>]</li>
<li>Ask to predict costs for food mix amounts between 36.5 and 42 tons. Example … “What is the cost to make 40 tons of the mix?” Answer … 190*40+12075 = $19675.</li>
<li>Ask to predict costs for food mix amounts not between 36.5 and 42 tons. Example … “What is the cost to make 70 tons of the mix?”</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Grey Kangaroo Example</strong>
<ol>
<li>response - Nasal width (mm x10)</li>
<li>explanatory - Nasal length (mm x10)</li>
<li>The slope is 0.2876.</li>
<li>The intercept is 46.451.</li>
<li>For every 1 unit (10 mm) increase in nasal length, the nasal width increases by 0.2876 units (i.e., 2.876 mm), on average.</li>
<li>The nasal width when the nasal length is 0 mm is 46.451 units (i.e., 464.51 mm), on average.</li>
<li>Ask to predict the nasal width when the nasal length (x10) is between 450 and 900. Example … “What is the predicted nasal width when the nasal length (x10) is 600 (i.e., 60 mm)?” Answer … Y=0.2876*600+46.451=219.01 (or 21.9 mm).</li>
<li>Ask to predict the nasal width when the nasal length (x10) is not between 450 and 900. Example … “What is the predicted nasal width when the nasal length (x10) is 250 (i.e., 25 mm)?”</li>

<div id="beach-sand" class="section level2">
<h2>Beach Sand</h2>
<ol>
<li>The equation of the best-fit line is SAND = 0.159+0.053*ANGLE</li>
<li>For each 1 degree increase in beach angle, the median sand diameter increases by 0.053 mm, on average.</li>
<li>If there is 0 beach angle, then the median sand diameter is 0.159 mm, on average.</li>
<li>This prediction should not be computed, because 15 degrees of beach angle is outside of the domain of the data used to define the relationship (i.e., this is an extrapolation).</li>
<li>The predicted median sand diameter for a beach angle of 4 degrees is 0.371 mm.</li>
<li>The residual for an observed median sand diamter of 0.2 mm and beach angle of 5 degrees is -0.224 mm.</li>
<li>The correlation coefficient between median sand diameter and beach angle is 0.955.</li>
<li>The proportion of variabiilty in median sand diameter that is explained by knowing the angle of the beach is 0.912.</li>
<li>I would expect the median sand diameter to increase by four slopes or 0.212 mm, on average, if the beach angle increased by 4 degrees.</li>
<li>The relationship betwen median sand diameter and beach angle appears to be nonlinear.</li>

<div id="class-excercise-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Class Excercise 3</h2>
<ol>
<li>The equation of the best-fit line is IBI=37.8242-0.5136*imp.</li>
<li>If the percent of impervious surface increases by 1%, then the IBI score decreases by 0.51, on average.</li>
<li>If the percent of impervious surface is 0, then the IBI score is 37.8, on average.</li>
<li>This questions is an extrapolation and should not be answered.</li>
<li>The IBI score is predicted to be 27.6 when the percent of impervious surface is 20%.</li>
<li>The residual for an observed IBI score of 20 and a percent of impervious surface of 30% is -2.4.</li>
<li>The IBI will change by -30 slopes or 15.4088 if the percentage of impervious surface is decreased by 30%. In other words the IBI will increase by 15.4088 units.</li>
<li>The correlation coefficient between IBI score and percent of impervious surface is -0.87.</li>
<li>The proportion of variability in IBI scores that is explained by knowing the percent of impervious surface is 0.76.</li>
<li>There appears to be homoscedasticity, but there is slight evidence of a curve suggesting that the relationship is nonlinear (Figure 1).</li>

<h2>Class Excercise 4</h2>
<ol>
<li>The equation of the best-fit line is COFFEESOLD = 45.3131-0.5693*MAXTEMP</li>
<li>For each additional degree of maximum temperature, the number of coffees sold decreases by 0.57, on average.</li>
<li>If the maximum temperature is 0F, then the number of coffees sold is 45.3, on average.</li>
<li>The predicted number of coffees sold if the maximum temperature if 40F is 22.5.</li>
<li>This question is an extrapolation and should not be answered.</li>
<li>The residual for an observation of 30 coffees sold when the maximum temperature was 40F is 7.5.</li>
<li>The correlation coefficient between the number of coffees sold and the maximum temperature is -0.74 (this should be interpreted cautiously as the relationship is slighly nonlinear; Figure 2).</li>
<li>The proportion of variability in number of coffees sold explained by knowing the maximum temperature is 0.55.</li>
<li>The relationship appears to be homoscedastic, but nonlinear (Figure 2).</li>
