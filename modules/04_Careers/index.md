    <div class="panel-body">In addition to class work and extracurricular activities, it is also important to get "field" experience such as work-study, internships, externships, or a job before you graduate. Key to getting one of these positions is understand which (and when) positions are available, developing an effective resume or curriculum vitae (a CV), writing effective cover letters, and interviewing well. Your advisor or professors can help you with some of these things but Northland also has an excellent professional that is here to help you find and successfully compete for these positions. You will be introduced to the Career Services resources in this module.
