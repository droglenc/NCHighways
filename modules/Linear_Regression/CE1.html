<h2>Equation of the Lines</h2>
<p>For each situation below, identify the (i) response variable, (ii) explanatory variable, (iii) slope, and (iv) intercept; interpret the (v) slope and (vi) intercept; (v) construct a valid prediction; and (v) identify what an extrapolation would be.</p>

<li>A student recorded the height of suds (mm) in a diswasher for ten different amounts of soap (g). The resulting best-fit line was Y=-20.2+12.4*X for 24&lt;Y&lt;80 and 3.5&lt;X&lt;8.0.</li>
<li>A farmer estimated the costs required to produce the daily livestock food mix (in tons) for a 20 day period. The resulting best-fit line was Y=190*X+12075 for 19000&lt;Y&lt;21000 and 36.5&lt;X&lt;42.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=ZO9800607">Poole and Carpenter (1980)</a> examined the relationship between nasal length (<strong>mm multiplied by 10</strong>) and nasal width (<strong>mm multiplied by 10</strong>) of Grey Kangaroos (<em>Macropus fuliginosus</em>). The resulting best fit line was WIDTH=0.2876*LENGTH+46.451 for 450&lt;LENGTH&lt;900 and 180&lt;WIDTH&lt;320.</li>

Their primary interest was in determining if the variability in sand granule size could be explained by the slope of the beach. The results of their analysis is shown in the scatterplot below.</td>

What is the correlation coefficient between median sand diameter and the beach slope? 1. What proportion of the variability in median sand diameter is explained by knowing the beach slope? 1. What aspect of this regression analysis concerns you (i.e., consider the regression assumptions)?</td>
