<h1>How do I see which data frames are attached?</h1>
<p>You can see which data frames are attached by typing <font face="Courier New" color="#FF0000">attached()</font> in R (note that the parentheses are needed and that the NCStats package must be loaded).  For example, the following command shows that the d2 and d1 data frames are attached.</p>

<pre><font color="#FF0000">> attached()</font>
<font color="#0000FF">[1] "d2" "d1"</font></pre>

<hr width="80%" size="5">

<p>Alternatively you can see all objects in the search path, includeing data frames that are attached, by either (1) typing <font face="Courier New" color="#FF0000">search()</font> or (2) selecting the "misc" menu and the "List search path" submenu in R.  Either option will return the list of objects in the search path.  The packages, ".GlobalEnv", and "Autoloads" will not be of interest to you.  The other items listed are likely data frames that you have attached.  For example, the following command shows that the d2 and d1 data frames are attached.</p>

<pre>
<font color="#FF0000">> search()</font>
<font color="#0000FF"> [1] ".GlobalEnv"        "d2"                "d1"               
 [4] "package:stats"     "package:graphics"  "package:grDevices"
 [7] "package:utils"     "package:datasets"  "package:methods"  
[10] "Autoloads"         "package:base" </font>
</pre>
