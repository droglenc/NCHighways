<h2>Equation of the Lines</h2>
<p>For each situation below, identify the (i) response variable, (ii) explanatory variable, (iii) slope, and (iv) intercept; interpret the (v) slope and (vi) intercept; (v) construct a valid prediction; and (v) identify what an extrapolation would be.</p>

<li>A student recorded the height of suds (mm) in a diswasher for ten different amounts of soap (g). The resulting best-fit line was Y=-20.2+12.4*X for 24&lt;Y&lt;80 and 3.5&lt;X&lt;8.0.</li>
<li>A farmer estimated the costs required to produce the daily livestock food mix (in tons) for a 20 day period. The resulting best-fit line was Y=190*X+12075 for 19000&lt;Y&lt;21000 and 36.5&lt;X&lt;42.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=ZO9800607">Poole and Carpenter (1980)</a> examined the relationship between nasal length (<strong>mm multiplied by 10</strong>) and nasal width (<strong>mm multiplied by 10</strong>) of Grey Kangaroos (<em>Macropus fuliginosus</em>). The resulting best fit line was WIDTH=0.2876*LENGTH+46.451 for 450&lt;LENGTH&lt;900 and 180&lt;WIDTH&lt;320.</li>

<h2>Beach Sand</h2>
<p><img src="../zimgs/beaches.jpg" alt="Beach Sand" class="img-right"> Geologists examined the relationship between the median diameter (mm) of sand granules and the slope (degrees) for nine ocean beaches. Their primary interest was in determining if the variability in sand granule size could be explained by the slope of the beach. The results of their analysis is shown in the scatterplot below.</p>
<p><img src="CE1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" title="" alt="" width="384" /></p>
<p>Use these results to answer the questions below.</p>
<ol>
<li>In terms of the variables of this problem, what is the equation of the best-fit line?</li>
<li>In terms of the variables of this problem, INTERPRET the value of the slope?</li>
<li>In terms of the variables of this problem, INTERPRET the value of the y-intercept?</li>
<li>What is the predicted median sand diameter for a beach slope of 0<sup>o</sup>?</li>
<li>What is the predicted median sand diameter for a beach slope of 4<sup>o</sup>?</li>
<li>What is the residual if the beach slope is 5<sup>o</sup> and the median sand diameter is 0.2 mm?</li>
<li>What is the correlation coefficient between median sand diameter and the beach slope?</li>
<li>What proportion of the variability in median sand diameter is explained by knowing the beach slope?</li>
<li>What aspect of this regression analysis concerns you (i.e., consider the regression assumptions)?</li>
